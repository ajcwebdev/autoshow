## Transcript

[00:00] - Hello, everybody.

[00:03] - Hello, welcome to the podcast.

[00:06] - Yeah.

[00:07] - We're just gonna jump straight in.

[00:08] - Woo.

[00:10] - Welcome to the podcast, another week.

[00:12] Simon, how are you?

[00:14] - Another week, I am very cold.

[00:16] You might hear in this episode

[00:17] that we both have a little crookiness in our voice.

[00:20] It's the middle of winter in Australia.

[00:22] It's a miserable rainy day outside.

[00:24] You can't see with the curtains,

[00:26] but it's cold and humid and kids,

[00:29] we were lamenting about having kids in winter

[00:32] and they always bring some sickness from school

[00:35] and then you just go in circle

[00:38] of like constantly being sick at home.

[00:40] - You just can't avoid it.

[00:41] Like kids just do not understand

[00:44] not spreading snot and saliva all over each other's faces.

[00:49] They just haven't learned that yet.

[00:51] And so it's just impossible

[00:53] to not catch some kind of sickness throughout winter.

[00:56] We actually had a not great one this weekend.

[01:00] We were away with a bunch of our kids' friends

[01:05] and their parents.

[01:06] It was a really lovely weekend away.

[01:07] We went to the beach,

[01:08] even though it was freezing cold and raining,

[01:10] but it was very nice.

[01:11] - I was gonna say.

[01:11] (laughing)

[01:13] - And while we were there,

[01:16] the first night we were there,

[01:17] our youngest, he's about two years old,

[01:19] vomited during the night.

[01:21] And that's always like a,

[01:24] is it one vomit or is it like,

[01:26] is it an isolated thing?

[01:28] Is it like a cold or like,

[01:31] is it due to him being just regularly sick

[01:33] or is it this thing called gastro

[01:35] or I'm sure there's a non-Australian name for this,

[01:39] but basically like a stomach flu

[01:41] that goes through the whole house.

[01:43] And that is unstoppable.

[01:44] Like everyone in the house is just vomiting

[01:47] and everything else that comes along with that.

[01:50] You don't have much control over your stomach.

[01:53] And so we were like,

[01:54] oh no, we're in this house,

[01:56] like in close quarters

[01:57] with like all of these other families

[01:59] and we're gonna spread it around.

[02:00] We're all just gonna be like locked down to this house

[02:03] or, you know, taking turns with the toilet.

[02:06] But then it didn't happen again.

[02:09] And I think maybe he,

[02:10] he maybe has like an insensitivity to strawberries.

[02:15] Sometimes when he has a bunch of strawberries,

[02:16] he just like, you know, vomits

[02:18] or it really upsets his stomach.

[02:20] And then other times he's fine.

[02:21] So it seemed fine.

[02:22] Like awesome, okay.

[02:24] No one else got sick the whole time,

[02:25] which was really good.

[02:26] And then of course on the drive home,

[02:28] while trying to get back to, you know,

[02:31] from an exhausted weekend

[02:33] where everyone just needs to rest,

[02:35] he threw up in the car

[02:36] and then we had to take everything out of the car

[02:38] and like clean everything

[02:40] and like change him

[02:41] and try and get-

[02:42] - It was down the creases of the baby seat

[02:45] and in the-

[02:45] - Yeah, yeah.

[02:46] No, it's deep in the baby seat.

[02:47] (laughs)

[02:49] - I've been there so many times.

[02:51] Drive the rest of the way home

[02:52] with that like stench of vomit.

[02:54] But yes, he seems fine now,

[02:57] but it was a bit of a stressful time.

[03:00] - Oh man.

[03:01] My kids are a bit older,

[03:02] but I've been through so many experiences just like this.

[03:05] Maybe that's the vomit episode,

[03:08] but I remember going to the snowy mountains

[03:11] from New South Wales, Sydney,

[03:12] where we used to live.

[03:14] There's at some point you,

[03:15] as mountains tend to do,

[03:16] you go to windy up and down roads.

[03:19] And we were like literally,

[03:21] I don't know exactly how far from the ski,

[03:23] but we were going on a ski trip

[03:25] and that was the last stretch.

[03:26] We had refueled petrol and we were like,

[03:28] okay, let's put the gear on the kids

[03:30] so that like we get out of the car

[03:31] and we go straight skiing.

[03:32] (laughs)

[03:34] Of course, like with like seven layers of jackets

[03:36] and gloves and stuff.

[03:37] (laughs)

[03:38] - It's not a good time for it.

[03:39] - This is when my daughter decided to be road sick

[03:42] and do the classic like vomit over every single possible,

[03:47] like part.

[03:49] - It's amazing how far it can spray.

[03:51] Again, like when you don't,

[03:52] when you're a kid and you just don't understand,

[03:54] like vomit into a bucket,

[03:56] like put it into a container,

[03:58] keep it contained.

[03:59] No, just spray it.

[04:01] (laughs)

[04:03] - When you said finish the drive

[04:06] with the stench in the back,

[04:07] that's exactly,

[04:08] I remember like finishing this.

[04:10] It's about seven hours from Sydney

[04:11] and the last 20, 30 minutes were like,

[04:15] and of course we didn't go skiing.

[04:16] We went, we parked on the parking

[04:17] and we watched everyone go skiing

[04:19] while we change all the layers.

[04:21] And we're like, okay,

[04:21] now we don't have ski gear.

[04:22] How can we ski?

[04:23] (groans)

[04:26] At the price of the ski trip in Australia

[04:28] and you're having a wonderful time.

[04:30] (laughs)

[04:32] - Yeah, that sounds like a stressful trip.

[04:36] At least it wasn't after you purchased everything

[04:38] and then realized you couldn't go.

[04:39] So like you'd purchased a Lyft ticket

[04:42] for the ludicrous amount of hundreds of dollars

[04:44] that it is for a Lyft pass for the day

[04:46] and hiring gear.

[04:48] - Yeah, we had to still rent stuff.

[04:49] We ended up putting her,

[04:51] shout out to Perisher in the snowy mountains,

[04:55] which happens to have a daycare on the mountain,

[04:57] that the tourism industry is very well polished down there

[05:02] so that you can arrive with nothing,

[05:04] like in jeans and normal shoes.

[05:06] And you literally like, you know,

[05:09] when you do the airport check

[05:10] where they make you spread your arms and legs

[05:11] for the x-ray.

[05:12] You go like this and they measure you,

[05:14] give you jacket, pants, stuff.

[05:15] Do you need childcare?

[05:16] Do you need lesson for the,

[05:17] like you, if you have money,

[05:19] you tick all the boxes and it's all taken care.

[05:22] - Yeah.

[05:23] - That's pretty impressive.

[05:24] - Yeah, it is very convenient.

[05:25] Is that not a thing in the rest of the world?

[05:27] Do they, like, I guess smaller mountains

[05:28] just wouldn't have the facilities to like,

[05:32] to have things like childcare and kids' lessons

[05:35] and stuff, right?

[05:35] - Yeah, so Perisher is the equivalent

[05:38] if you were in Switzerland,

[05:39] that would be Zermatt or Camp Montana,

[05:41] like the big, big, fancy resorts.

[05:44] I grew up in a proximity of three or four

[05:47] really small, low-key resorts.

[05:49] So there would be one ski shop somewhere in the village

[05:53] and everyone rocks up with stuff

[05:56] because they know, like, you gotta organize it beforehand

[05:59] 'cause it's a small, low-key resort,

[06:00] but tourists would show up

[06:01] and then line up in this one sports shop,

[06:05] which has like, not particularly enthusiastic

[06:09] and hospitality-trained staff,

[06:13] which are pretty grumpy and it takes forever to rent

[06:16] and they don't have much choice.

[06:17] And yeah, discovering how it works in Australia

[06:21] and also in Park City, like a couple of months ago in Utah,

[06:25] just you go and you can choose six models

[06:28] and they have these demo boards and it's all super,

[06:30] it takes three minutes to get all your gear.

[06:33] Yeah, my experience renting stuff in Switzerland

[06:35] is way more, it's also 10 years in the past,

[06:38] so you might have caught up,

[06:40] but I've always thought like,

[06:42] when I discovered the proper way of doing it,

[06:44] I was like, oh, we are so behind in terms of like,

[06:48] providing an experience and a like, happy, quick service.

[06:51] It's just like, yeah, stand there

[06:53] and they ignore you for like 45 minutes

[06:54] and you're like,

[06:55] you can see people who drove from Geneva airport

[06:58] and they're like, I wanna go ski,

[06:59] just give me something and I'll pay, whatever.

[07:01] - But that's the thing, they're not turning around

[07:04] and being like, I'm flying back out of here,

[07:05] so they don't really have a choice.

[07:08] There's no reason to increase the customer service.

[07:12] - Yeah, so my friend,

[07:14] we have promised our very large audience of seven,

[07:18] which is my mom, your partner.

[07:22] - Yeah, Kara, when she gets around to editing our podcast,

[07:27] she has to watch it.

[07:29] What about our active listeners?

[07:30] - The view count goes,

[07:32] but we have promised for like three or four weeks now

[07:35] to kind of talk about what we wanna do,

[07:38] have like some sort of a little adult like plan

[07:41] with the podcast in terms of like,

[07:43] what sort of, if we wanna have different topics

[07:45] or maybe bring some guests along

[07:47] and maybe think about the format

[07:49] a little bit more consistent.

[07:51] Although we both agree,

[07:52] it's kind of cool to be like YOLO free handing it

[07:56] and kind of like, if it's a bit longer or a bit shorter

[07:59] or a bit unstructured, this is good as well.

[08:02] So do you have any specific topics

[08:06] you would like to bring up?

[08:07] We're going to do this finally this week.

[08:10] - Yeah, goal number one.

[08:12] Actually release the podcast.

[08:14] This is something that I have not been doing well.

[08:17] I think we have like-

[08:18] - The what?

[08:19] We have a podcast?

[08:20] - We have an audio version of this, seriously?

[08:23] You wouldn't know it if you were subscribing to us

[08:25] on Spotify or Apple podcast

[08:30] or any of the other podcast platforms,

[08:32] because I have been doing a terrible job

[08:34] of actually uploading them after we finished recording.

[08:37] When we finish recording, I'm always like,

[08:39] all right, what do I need to do this week?

[08:41] And just work takes over and my whole week disappears.

[08:45] And so yes, we are going to get better

[08:48] at actually releasing these right after we record the video,

[08:52] quickly get it out in audio form

[08:57] and also do a nicer version for YouTube, I reckon,

[09:02] chopping off the start and end and maybe stacking us

[09:07] or yeah, maybe putting it out on Twitter

[09:09] or something like that.

[09:10] Anyway, being more professional

[09:11] about how we actually package it up and put it out

[09:14] rather than just doing this live thing

[09:16] that gets like, you know, 30 views after we're finished

[09:20] and then being like, all right, cool,

[09:21] we recorded another podcast.

[09:23] Yeah, need to get better at it.

[09:25] - That ties in perfectly in one thing I wanted to touch on

[09:29] and you feel free to push back if you don't think it's good,

[09:31] but I kind of want to try to have the episodes

[09:35] a bit shorter intentionally.

[09:37] And right now we kind of talk

[09:39] and when it reaches one hour,

[09:40] it's like, ah, we should just maybe cut it off

[09:43] and then we go into the sick peaks for another half an hour.

[09:47] And so I was like, I'd love the idea of aiming

[09:49] for like have 30 minutes as like a sort of like guideline.

[09:54] And when you reach 30 minutes,

[09:56] you consider wrapping up with like a little sick peak.

[09:58] So it ends up anywhere between 30 minutes and three hours.

[10:02] But what you just said is something

[10:07] that was going through my mind.

[10:08] If we have little shorter recordings

[10:10] and we try to start as closely

[10:12] as the whatever time we choose,

[10:14] we can use that like extra gain free time

[10:19] after the recording to quickly,

[10:22] like I always want to do this like short,

[10:26] like, ah, this moment was really cool.

[10:27] I want to do a little clip.

[10:29] And then if you don't do it after,

[10:30] you kind of forget about the episode.

[10:31] But if we record and right after it's taken 45 minutes,

[10:35] I'm like, oh, I've blocked an hour

[10:36] and a bit for this recording.

[10:38] I'm like, I can very quickly now in Notion

[10:41] or anywhere just make notes.

[10:43] These things we said we should do a clip

[10:45] and kind of just do some like pre-planning

[10:48] of how to make like extra content

[10:51] or like write the description of the episode

[10:55] and put it on the website or as a draft or whatever.

[10:58] Like do that sort of prep work.

[11:00] You can even maybe edit the audio.

[11:02] Like, I don't, yeah, just do some of this admin stuff

[11:06] we have to do because it's just us.

[11:08] I mean, your wife is helping us,

[11:11] but it's not like we have a team

[11:13] of dedicated assistants doing lots of stuff, so.

[11:16] - She's not helping enough.

[11:17] Otherwise we would be, you know,

[11:18] actually releasing the episodes.

[11:20] - But I thought, yeah, shorter episode means more

[11:23] easy to consume for the audience.

[11:25] And then we can reclaim some of the time

[11:28] that we can invest in doing this sort of like

[11:31] adult professional management.

[11:32] And usually I'm cutting you off from talking

[11:35] and talking and talking at about 60 minutes.

[11:37] So I'm happy to cut you off from talking and talking,

[11:39] talking at about 30 minutes.

[11:40] If you'd like.

[11:41] - Speaking of.

[11:41] (laughing)

[11:44] No, yeah.

[11:45] - But yeah, this sounds like a very good idea.

[11:46] And I feel like just generally

[11:47] like a 30 minute podcast is probably much more consumable

[11:51] than a hour or, you know, most of our podcasts,

[11:54] like you're saying, we start thinking

[11:56] about wrapping it up at an hour.

[11:57] Maybe we should start thinking about wrapping it up

[11:59] at like 20 minutes and jump into seg pics

[12:02] so that the whole thing is like 30 minutes.

[12:04] 'Cause I think at the moment it's about.

[12:06] - It's probably an hour plus.

[12:07] - Close to an hour and a half for each of the episodes.

[12:10] - Yeah, I don't want it to be too rigid and stuff.

[12:14] Like I, one podcast I've started listening to,

[12:16] I really, really enjoy is Matt Stauffer

[12:19] from the Laravel ecosystem.

[12:20] It's called The Business of Laravel.

[12:22] And he talks about people who built real businesses

[12:25] using Laravel and how they went about it.

[12:27] So Aaron Francis was on there

[12:29] and also his podcast partner, Ian Lansman.

[12:33] And the whole discussion,

[12:35] you can see Matt like being cognizant of the time.

[12:38] He's like, oh, I want to ask these two questions.

[12:40] I realized we have 10 minutes left.

[12:41] And it is like, you can tell there's a timer

[12:44] going on the side and they're trying to always stick

[12:46] to half an hour to 40 minutes.

[12:49] And I do like the fact that, you know,

[12:52] it's going to be a condensed episode

[12:53] and you can like around your lifestyle,

[12:56] if you have a drive that is 20 minutes

[12:59] and then you listen at 1X, 1.5X or two,

[13:02] like you can, you know, it's going to be exactly this time

[13:04] and you can consume that thing.

[13:06] It's kind of nice to have a predictable

[13:07] without being completely Swiss precision about it.

[13:11] - Yeah, that's a good point.

[13:14] Why aren't you the one keeping track of the time?

[13:16] Come on.

[13:17] - Why do you think I am an expat?

[13:21] I had to flee this like overly organized and serious

[13:26] and you need to do the right thing

[13:29] and stay in your lane stuff to spread my wings

[13:32] and be able to be free.

[13:34] I needed to go to Australia, which is much more laid back.

[13:37] - The laziest country where time doesn't really matter.

[13:41] - No, the laziest country is Greece.

[13:42] My dad's Greek and in Greece, they have a common saying,

[13:46] which means let's do it tomorrow.

[13:47] Like whatever you ask is Avrio, Avrio means tomorrow.

[13:52] If you go to Greece, like within one or two days,

[13:54] you'll ask a question.

[13:54] Someone will say Avrio and it means tomorrow.

[13:57] And basically it's like, ah.

[14:00] - Later, another time.

[14:01] - It doesn't mean tomorrow, it means not now.

[14:04] - Yeah, it's the Greek version of,

[14:06] we'll circle back to this next.

[14:08] - Yes, let's take it offline.

[14:10] - Yeah, let's take it offline.

[14:12] All of those, yeah.

[14:14] - Let's fix it later.

[14:14] - But yes, like you were saying, you know,

[14:17] one time when you do need to be very cautious of time

[14:20] or aware of time is when you have guests,

[14:22] which is another thing that we wanna get into.

[14:24] So we've been talking about this since the start.

[14:26] We have had one guest on the Next.js episode.

[14:30] - Yeah, Luke Bennett, friend of sneak meal

[14:32] and friend period, a good friend of mine.

[14:35] Yeah, so shout out to Luke because the idea

[14:38] of having these guests happened 15 minutes

[14:41] before the actual live recording.

[14:44] - Yeah.

[14:45] - There was Next.js conf that happened.

[14:47] And I, just before we went live,

[14:49] you and I, I could see in our team Slack,

[14:52] we have a very vibrant Slack channel at SyncMeal

[14:55] and Luke was doing this recap of the Next.js conf

[14:59] 'cause he obviously got up early or stayed up late

[15:01] to catch up with it.

[15:03] And I was like, I just poked, hey, how did,

[15:06] he's never been on a live podcast

[15:07] or anything at that point.

[15:09] How do you feel about going live with your camera

[15:12] on full screen on YouTube to give us a recap of stuff?

[15:16] And shout out, he was like, okay, I'll do that.

[15:20] Yeah, yeah, I can, I think I can do it.

[15:22] And he jumped in and gave us a really cool recap.

[15:24] And yeah, that was awesome.

[15:25] And he's the only guest at this point for the whole--

[15:28] - Actually, we had one more special surprise short guest.

[15:33] - That wasn't a guest, it was a replacement for you.

[15:36] We didn't show up.

[15:37] - And who was it?

[15:40] - Ken C Dodds blessed us with eight minutes in his Tesla

[15:44] while waiting for his kids to finish a music lesson.

[15:48] So that was the week, literally, not a week,

[15:50] like two or three days after Epic Web Conf.

[15:53] I planned to tell John about the whole conference

[15:57] and you couldn't be present.

[15:59] And I was like, oh, let's do next week.

[16:00] And then I was like, no, it just happened.

[16:02] So there's like this breaking news, whatever,

[16:06] slash I am super enthusiastic

[16:08] and I have my sunburn from the skiing and all the stuff.

[16:12] And so I thought I'll go YOLO.

[16:14] And I went YOLO.

[16:15] And in the background, I just said to Kent,

[16:17] hey, I'm doing this.

[16:19] I'm doing this.

[16:20] Like if you know any of the speakers, whatever.

[16:22] No, I didn't say to Kent.

[16:23] I sent to the whole speaker lineup

[16:24] and even the conference discord, all the attendees,

[16:28] if anyone wants to jump in and share the recap with me.

[16:32] And then while I was presenting,

[16:34] after 45 minutes of talking by myself,

[16:37] I hear that little interview ring

[16:40] because I had shared the link and I pick up

[16:42] and it's Kent C. Dodds sitting in his car

[16:44] and he was like, I've got eight minutes.

[16:45] And so we went straight into like,

[16:47] here, the floor is yours, whatever you want to say.

[16:49] And yeah, that was cool.

[16:51] - That's awesome.

[16:51] And just to, just in case you're wondering

[16:55] how much Simon actually saw this as a replacement for me

[16:58] in the audio file of that episode,

[17:01] like we upload the audio and video.

[17:04] - Does it say John?

[17:05] - So I can edit it.

[17:06] Yeah, usually it's John and Simon.

[17:09] And this one was Simon and Kent C. Myers.

[17:12] So he really worked hard to replace me.

[17:17] But yeah, there's a whole bunch of people we want to get on.

[17:22] Selma White Panther would be awesome to get on,

[17:25] Anthony Campolo, Aaron Francis would be an awesome person

[17:30] to get on, there's heaps.

[17:32] - Yeah, there's, we have a sneaky list

[17:34] that keeps growing of people that we on Twitter

[17:38] or in person kind of planted the seed

[17:40] and like, oh, I'd love to come.

[17:41] So we kind of want to start doing this.

[17:44] And yes, like you said, this kind of is when you,

[17:48] when you bring other people in

[17:50] and you kind of have to be a bit more intentional

[17:53] about the start time and how long they should block.

[17:57] So I just, we start at 9.30,

[17:58] but sometimes 10, quarter past 10,

[18:00] because we just hang out and then,

[18:03] so block three hours and you should be good.

[18:05] Like we don't want to do that.

[18:07] So yeah, start at my, I think aiming for 30 minutes

[18:11] and if it goes to 40, it's fine.

[18:13] If we have 43 already, maybe we'd say,

[18:18] hey, we're not going to do sick picks this week

[18:19] because that's a can of worms for another 15 minutes easily

[18:22] 'cause we get so excited.

[18:24] - Simon's just really hoping for that

[18:26] because he hasn't, I'm looking at the board now

[18:28] and he hasn't added any sick picks.

[18:30] I catch him off guard every week.

[18:33] - I have one, good one.

[18:35] - Okay, all right, he's got one to go.

[18:36] - Ready to go.

[18:37] - Yeah, the other thing with guests I wanted to touch on

[18:40] is we, I don't think we have the clout just yet to say,

[18:45] this is our rules if you want to show up, whatever,

[18:49] but we want to be intentional in trying to keep

[18:51] that Australian morning time slot,

[18:54] which kind of works with the US and most of the world,

[18:56] except maybe Europe, instead of doing,

[19:00] maybe like if there's one specific case,

[19:02] we might do like record in the evening

[19:04] and not do it live or even do live,

[19:06] but the idea is to try to, with this podcast,

[19:09] like America has dozens of amazing live podcasts

[19:13] and I don't know many other Australian duos or singles

[19:18] that do like some tech podcasts.

[19:21] So we want to try to, even if we usually have zero to one

[19:24] or two people watching live,

[19:25] but we want to try to create that intentionally

[19:29] APAC friendly time zone production.

[19:32] So if you want to come, I guess the idea was like,

[19:36] it would probably be your evening,

[19:37] most places you live in the world,

[19:39] unless you live in Australia or,

[19:42] actually we have so much overlap with like Philippines,

[19:45] India, Indonesia, like there's a lot of countries

[19:48] where there's really interesting people.

[19:49] And I kind of am brainwashed from trying to,

[19:53] when I do my workshops with Epic Web or Pro Tailwind,

[19:56] I cater for San Francisco and LA

[19:59] and West Coast of the United States,

[20:02] but that's not the only two options.

[20:04] It's not our time zone or Pacific time,

[20:07] there's plenty of other places to go.

[20:10] - And yeah, as you said, like right now with us,

[20:14] I guess we're not in daylight savings

[20:17] and I guess maybe the US is in daylight savings.

[20:19] Anyway, there's like a nice overlap at the moment

[20:22] of yeah, our not too ridiculously early in the morning,

[20:27] it lines up nicely with the not too ridiculous late

[20:31] in the US.

[20:32] And so, yeah, give it like two months

[20:35] and that won't be the case.

[20:37] It'll be another like ridiculous situation

[20:39] where it's 4 a.m. or something in the States, but.

[20:42] - Yeah, it's two hour spread

[20:45] because everyone moves up one hour the other way.

[20:46] It makes, even with my family,

[20:49] like the kids try to speak with the grandparents

[20:51] and sometimes I try to speak with them too,

[20:54] but we try to organize the grandkids and grandchildren

[20:57] for the relationship and because they know me.

[21:01] I'm not changing anymore.

[21:03] Well, I'm probably, but we find a time

[21:06] that works perfectly right after dinner.

[21:08] And then when it becomes the routine,

[21:09] it's just like gets all jacked up because we changed him.

[21:12] And now it's like, oh, let's maybe before breakfast

[21:15] in the morning, it's gonna work.

[21:17] The Europe and Australia's East Coast

[21:20] is probably the most ridiculous 12 hour, not 12,

[21:24] but it's like almost 12.

[21:26] It goes from 10 to eight.

[21:27] And that just, kids go to bed quite early

[21:30] and my parents sleep quite late in the morning

[21:33] because they're retired and they earned it

[21:35] to not have to get up early.

[21:37] So there's, the window gets surprisingly difficult

[21:41] very easily.

[21:42] - Yeah.

[21:44] So something else we wanna do other than guests is,

[21:47] well, something I wanna do is have like some more

[21:53] kind of fun game style episodes.

[21:56] I used to love, what was that podcast

[21:59] that I used to listen to a lot about JavaScript?

[22:02] What's the JavaScript one?

[22:04] - I don't know.

[22:05] - Something.

[22:07] - Is it two people more, there's so many.

[22:10] - Yeah, no, frontend happy hour was one of them.

[22:14] And then there was another one.

[22:15] Anyway, it was always fun when they had guests on

[22:18] and they like just basically did like a fun little

[22:21] trivia session or with syntax there's like stumped

[22:26] is one of the categories of episodes I used to do.

[22:30] So I think it'd be really fun to have.

[22:33] - To expose ourselves.

[22:34] - Yeah, expose ourselves and how little we actually know

[22:37] and do some like interview style questions

[22:41] about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and maybe SQL as well.

[22:45] We'll see, we'll see how either of us will do on SQL.

[22:48] - I'll ask the questions.

[22:50] - But yeah, I think that'd be a fun way to start it

[22:54] and kind of design it with some points

[22:58] and things that don't really matter

[23:00] but just to have some fun.

[23:01] And then we could have other styles of it

[23:05] like Jeopardy style ones or just some fun little game style

[23:10] episodes that we could kind of sprinkle

[23:14] in there occasionally.

[23:15] - This is great.

[23:16] This is a great idea.

[23:17] When you brought that up, my instant like imposter syndrome

[23:21] you think was like, oh, I don't want Java.

[23:22] What if I can't answer the question?

[23:24] And I was like, so what?

[23:25] Like, whatever.

[23:26] I've got skills that other people don't have.

[23:29] I definitely have not skills that people have, but so what?

[23:33] And so I thought like it may as well

[23:36] because typically these stumped question is like JavaScript,

[23:38] TypeScript, CSS, whatever.

[23:41] And I thought because we both create a lot of videos

[23:44] and stuff, we could expand to do some funny questions

[23:47] about like different types of microphone

[23:49] or lighting techniques or editing,

[23:51] or what's a ripple delete or like whatever,

[23:54] like expand this quiz to more areas than just programming.

[23:59] - Yeah.

[24:01] - And then because as everyone knows,

[24:03] John always picks Ryobi tools for his six bits.

[24:06] We were joking that maybe we can even expand

[24:10] like some quiz of like the lawnmower line from Ryobi

[24:15] and like some technicalities between the 36 volt

[24:18] versus 18 volt battery mower.

[24:21] - You have no idea how much I'm going to win in this.

[24:24] Like you don't want to challenge me on Ryobi tool trivia.

[24:29] - But yeah, I think it's great.

[24:32] And the whole genre, it's a French word, by the way,

[24:37] you say genre in French.

[24:41] - John, genre.

[24:42] - Genre, the whole genre of a game/quiz/question/answer

[24:47] is really cool and appealing to me.

[24:51] I think it'd be good fun.

[24:52] And you can also combine it with the previous topic,

[24:55] which is having guests and like bring guests

[24:56] and do fun stuff.

[24:58] - I like that a lot.

[24:59] - And I would love to just like have a chat with guests

[25:03] about something they're working on

[25:06] or their history or whatever.

[25:07] That would be fun.

[25:08] And it would give us an excuse to bring them back as well

[25:10] if we had like a quiz happening

[25:13] or we could like pick two competing technologies

[25:16] and run a quiz between the--

[25:19] - Pit them against each other.

[25:20] - Yeah, work out which one is the best dev tool

[25:23] by seeing how well they do with interview questions.

[25:28] - That's great.

[25:29] I really like this.

[25:30] Another sort of topic idea ahead.

[25:33] And of course, now I forgot.

[25:36] The whole last minute, I was in my head thinking of this.

[25:39] All right, if you get something, it'll pop back in my head,

[25:44] but I was thinking of--

[25:45] - Okay, and so, yes.

[25:49] Another, see, I really, back on the like game stuff,

[25:53] like I love board games and I always find it's like,

[25:56] you know, a fun way to, like over the weekend,

[25:59] we played so much Uno, like an insane amount of Uno

[26:03] and not with the kids.

[26:04] Like we waited until the kids went to bed.

[26:06] And as soon as the kids were out of the picture,

[26:09] it was glasses of wine and Uno for just hours.

[26:14] Like we stayed up until like 12 o'clock

[26:16] just playing Uno one after another.

[26:17] And it was really nice having those kinds of like

[26:19] simple games where like,

[26:22] you're still able to kind of have a conversation,

[26:25] but it gives you something to kind of,

[26:27] to concentrate on if there are some lulls

[26:30] in the conversation or if--

[26:32] - A prompt.

[26:33] It's great.

[26:34] Uno is amazing.

[26:35] We camp a lot and we definitely play Uno a lot

[26:37] with the kids most of the time,

[26:39] but I like the idea of like, go to bed

[26:41] and then we can have a--

[26:43] - Adults only Uno.

[26:46] - Yeah.

[26:47] It's funny, a random side quest,

[26:49] which is how we end up in our long episode,

[26:51] but I saw a tweet from a Taylor Otwell,

[26:55] creator of Laravel.

[26:57] And he was like, what is in your list of like,

[27:00] you call it S tier, like the top tier software.

[27:04] And he was like, the constraints are like,

[27:07] it's super simple, incredibly powerful and easy

[27:12] and stuff like that.

[27:12] In his list, there was Trello and there was spreadsheets

[27:17] and it's undeniably both, you can do crazy stuff with it

[27:20] and it's pretty intuitive and you can learn the basics

[27:24] really quickly and then go deep.

[27:26] And I think in a non-software way,

[27:28] the Uno game is part of this, like it's super simple

[27:32] and it creates so many experiences from two people to like,

[27:36] I don't know, I've played Uno at New Year's Eve

[27:38] with like families and cousins and like 15 plus people.

[27:42] And we played from 6 p.m. till midnight, nonstop

[27:45] and no one wanted to stop.

[27:46] Like, ah, who cares about the fireworks, we're playing Uno.

[27:49] - Yeah, yeah, that was our weekend.

[27:52] It was like, anytime there was just like a break,

[27:55] like, oh, like a couple of people need to shower

[27:58] and then we're gonna go to the playground or whatever.

[28:00] It was like, quick game Uno, let's break out the deck.

[28:04] It's like, it's so simple, there's no setup, it's great.

[28:06] - I gotta say, I really respect and appreciate the fact

[28:10] that you say Uno, because it's, again, it's Italian.

[28:13] I'm Swiss and we speak Italian and German and French.

[28:16] So Uno means one in Italian.

[28:18] And that's why when there's one card, you say Uno.

[28:21] And my kids say, you know,

[28:23] and I'm expecting most English-speaking people say,

[28:28] you wanna play Uno?

[28:29] And I'm like, Uno, you gotta say Uno.

[28:33] And like, they know and they say it sometimes

[28:37] but they always revert back to the Aussie, you know.

[28:40] And it just, it does my head in.

[28:42] I'm sorry, if you play Uno, call it Uno.

[28:45] - Yeah, Uno, Uno, for sure.

[28:48] Did you remember what you were gonna say?

[28:51] - Yes, now I'm gonna forget again.

[28:53] No, I remember.

[28:54] All right.

[28:57] Yes, now I remember again that I forgot that I remember.

[29:03] - We're not editing the podcast anymore, Simon.

[29:05] - No, it's live.

[29:07] Ship it live, man.

[29:09] We are live, actually.

[29:10] The other topic I would like to do,

[29:12] but this requests us to find a better way

[29:14] to collect more questions is this like mailbag,

[29:17] sort of like, send a question.

[29:19] We've kind of done that on the website with the suggestion,

[29:22] but it's because our audience is so big,

[29:25] it hasn't really caught up.

[29:28] But maybe a more intentional on Twitter,

[29:30] like say, hey, we're going live tomorrow,

[29:32] like send us a question.

[29:33] We wanna do mailbag stuff or AMA or whatever.

[29:36] And it just, I have a list of questions.

[29:38] So not that we ever stuck for topics,

[29:40] but it's kind of nice to mix it up with like,

[29:42] hey, let's do listeners question episode.

[29:44] And we go through anything from one to six, 10, 20,

[29:49] whatever gets us to the 30 minutes,

[29:52] which by the way,

[29:53] we are 29 minutes and 56 seconds right now.

[29:57] - Gonna wrap it up, Simon.

[29:58] I'm afraid I gotta cut you off there

[30:00] and move on to sick pics.

[30:01] - Yeah, but we wanted to talk about the future.

[30:04] We wanted to be a little bit more short and on time,

[30:08] have guests and have episodes about games and stuff

[30:12] and AMA, mailbag.

[30:13] So we've covered all of this and I think

[30:16] it's pretty good format.

[30:18] - So if you head to navbar.tech/suggestions,

[30:23] oh, no, the deployment's disabled.

[30:29] (laughing)

[30:31] I think our site's down.

[30:33] I'll fix that up before you try and go there.

[30:37] But if you go to navbar.tech/suggestions,

[30:42] you can request an episode that you would like us to cover

[30:45] or a topic you would like us to cover.

[30:48] 'Cause yeah, we would love to cover some things

[30:50] that you folks are interested in hearing about.

[30:54] Otherwise we're just gonna keep talking about Ryobi tools.

[30:56] - Yeah.

[30:58] Yes, so this is basically the very crux

[31:03] of making the NavBar sustainable for us,

[31:07] fun and more mature and capable of bringing people along.

[31:11] And who knows, maybe one day bring sponsors or whatever,

[31:15] like someone wants to acquire us for $2 billion.

[31:17] I guess to do that,

[31:20] you need to have some sort of structure to it.

[31:24] This is the goal, isn't it?

[31:25] Retire wealthy from a podcast.

[31:28] - That's right.

[31:29] - Or continue doing it, but sustainably.

[31:31] Yes, so with all that.

[31:35] - Do you have a sick pick for me, Simon?

[31:36] - I do.

[31:37] - Oh, yes.

[31:38] - I haven't put it.

[31:39] We have this little back channel thing notes,

[31:41] but I'm very off the cup.

[31:45] So I didn't put it,

[31:46] but my sick pick this week is DaVinci Resolve

[31:50] and specifically the Fusion page in DaVinci Resolve.

[31:54] So if you don't know,

[31:56] DaVinci Resolve is a video editing software,

[32:01] but instead of doing just video editing,

[32:03] it does the whole umbrella of editing videos,

[32:08] but also doing motion graphics like chapter tiles

[32:12] and the special effects and explosions and wobbly things.

[32:16] And then audio engineering and color correction,

[32:19] color grading, all that stuff.

[32:21] Typically, if you're in the Adobe world,

[32:23] you have like Adobe Premiere for the editing.

[32:27] And then you export everything to After Effects

[32:30] for the special effects

[32:31] and export everything to Adobe Audition,

[32:33] or I don't know how it's called, the audio one.

[32:36] Or if you're on Apple,

[32:37] you have Final Cut Pro for the editing.

[32:39] And then I think you still,

[32:40] you can do a bit of motion graphics,

[32:42] but if you want to go full on Hollywood movies,

[32:45] you have to go to After Effects, which is Adobe.

[32:47] So you have to pay for the subscription.

[32:49] Anyway, Resolve has that amazing thing,

[32:52] which is the shared state timeline between all these apps.

[32:56] So you edit your video,

[32:58] and then if you want to do some motion graphics,

[33:00] you go to that Fusion page and they have the same timeline,

[33:04] and you can start making motion graphics,

[33:06] which get embedded in your timeline.

[33:08] And if you want to change the audio,

[33:09] you go to the audio page and it's still the same timeline.

[33:12] So it's basically having multiple apps

[33:15] that share the same editing cut timeline you work on.

[33:18] - That workflow is just so good.

[33:20] Like, yeah, having to move it

[33:21] into a completely different app is just such,

[33:24] like, so time-consuming,

[33:25] and then exporting it back out of there

[33:26] and putting it back in.

[33:27] And especially if you're then crossing over,

[33:29] like you were saying, those different brands,

[33:30] like if you're editing in Apple stuff,

[33:33] like moving it across to an Adobe application

[33:37] to do After Effects stuff,

[33:38] and then moving it back again to Apple,

[33:40] like it would just, yeah, it's a nightmare.

[33:42] And so just being able to click on a tab

[33:44] and you're already there,

[33:44] like your whole project, whatever you're working on,

[33:47] right there, and you can start working on motion graphics.

[33:49] - Yeah, it's incredible.

[33:50] Like, Resolve is a big, big, big,

[33:53] like, learning curve, especially Fusion.

[33:57] But it's so rewarding that everything you do,

[33:59] you will probably never reach the ceiling

[34:04] of what the software can do.

[34:05] Just for context, people in Hollywood studio,

[34:08] like the Marvel movies are edited with Resolve.

[34:11] Like, if you go on the Resolve website,

[34:13] you can see all these crazy Hollywood,

[34:16] like top class, top tier movies, editing with Resolve.

[34:20] And so I don't think us little YouTube

[34:22] dev ed content creators will hit that limit.

[34:27] But on your point, I've shared a little clip

[34:30] from a video this morning from Casey Ferris,

[34:32] who's a really good YouTube teacher for Resolve stuff,

[34:35] and I learned all my Fusion stuff from.

[34:37] And he's got this example where there's a lady

[34:40] who takes a chicken nugget and opens it.

[34:42] And he's like, "Oh, imagine you wanted to reinforce

[34:45] that it's steamy hot and you want a bit of steam coming out."

[34:48] And he's like, "Okay, in After Effects,

[34:50] like in whatever editing Final Cut or Premiere,

[34:53] you would export the whole project

[34:55] and then import in After Effects and add your little smoke,

[34:58] and then re-export that,

[35:00] and then re-import in your editing stuff."

[35:02] And then you're like, "Oh, it's a bit too much.

[35:03] Let's re-export and just do that dance so many times."

[35:07] And he's like, "Check this out.

[35:08] Click on Fusion tab, create a, it's called a little,

[35:11] like a fractal noise, whatever, that makes some clouds."

[35:15] And then he makes a mask so it just scoped to right

[35:18] at the opening of the chicken nugget.

[35:20] And then he goes back to the edit page,

[35:21] and there's smoke coming out of the nugget.

[35:23] And it's like he never left the app or the workflow,

[35:27] and it took about 10, 15 seconds.

[35:29] And that really drives the point home

[35:31] of why it's a good investment to learn this,

[35:34] even if you already know After Effects.

[35:36] But this is my sick pick because this past week,

[35:40] I've really played, I've started going on a deep dive on Fusion,

[35:44] and I've discovered it is very similar to programming,

[35:47] and funny enough, to Tailwind CSS philosophy.

[35:50] The way Fusion works, there's a little thing called a node

[35:54] for each single purpose function,

[35:56] exactly like Tailwind utility class,

[35:58] where you combine padding and background colors

[36:00] and border and all that stuff.

[36:02] In Fusion, you have a background and a text node

[36:04] and then a merge to merge them together,

[36:06] and then a transform to zoom in or rotate them.

[36:09] And instead of just clicking on your text and rotate it,

[36:11] you're like, "Okay, I need to transform the text.

[36:13] So I will pipe it into a transform node."

[36:16] And the transform node is where you do the rotation.

[36:18] And so you compose all these little nodes together,

[36:21] and it gives this incredible composability

[36:24] that you can do anything you think of with just simple,

[36:28] single-purpose nodes that you can assemble

[36:31] in like Lego blocks, basically.

[36:33] And it's really cool.

[36:34] Then you can export it as a reusable component with props.

[36:38] So I've made that title thing.

[36:40] I know John knows because I select him the result,

[36:42] and I tweeted it yesterday.

[36:44] I've created this cool title, and I was like,

[36:47] I imagine people would change the color, the text,

[36:49] whatever it says, and then that's it.

[36:51] And so you expose these as options in, it's called a macro,

[36:55] but it's kind of like a React component

[36:56] with props and props API.

[36:59] And then people drag your new fun title component

[37:01] you've created, and all they can do is put the text,

[37:04] choose the color,

[37:05] and then they have the thing completely made.

[37:08] And you can right-click and explode it

[37:10] to kind of eject and control all the parts,

[37:12] but it's so cool, and it's very program-y-like,

[37:15] and I really, really enjoy that.

[37:17] - Yeah, and you can actually do

[37:20] some actual programming in it too.

[37:22] So I've also been playing with this recently.

[37:26] I did a, for our Superbases now, GA video,

[37:31] which we put out a couple of months ago.

[37:33] I, yeah, I got right into the motion graphics stuff

[37:37] and doing like animated text things.

[37:42] And one of them was like a counter

[37:45] that counted up to 1 million databases

[37:48] that we're now hosting at Superbase.

[37:50] And so, yeah, you can write these like expressions

[37:54] that can basically, yeah,

[37:57] like loop through a collection of numbers

[37:59] over a specific amount of time.

[38:01] And that's just like the beginning.

[38:05] Like there's this whole,

[38:06] the whole Lua programming language

[38:07] is exposed under the hood.

[38:10] And so you can, yeah,

[38:12] you can write any kind of programming stuff you want,

[38:15] which is just so helpful when you're,

[38:18] when you are a software developer or whatever,

[38:21] and your mind thinks like that.

[38:23] How, like, how can I write a little logical expression

[38:28] that's gonna do this thing for me,

[38:30] rather than understanding how to do

[38:33] like design and motion graphics things.

[38:35] It's nice being able to access all of it.

[38:40] Yeah, and it's exposed to every single field.

[38:42] It's something I hadn't realized,

[38:43] but any text field inputs,

[38:46] if you type equal,

[38:48] it's exactly like in Excel spreadsheets.

[38:51] If you type equals, you enter,

[38:53] oh, you're gonna give me a formula or some function.

[38:56] And a quick example I did in my title,

[38:59] I did this stop motion feel like,

[39:02] instead of it being too fluid

[39:04] when the letters come up and bounce

[39:05] and then land in position,

[39:07] I want it to be, to have that kind of like stop motion

[39:09] every six frames or so.

[39:11] So it's kind of jittery on purpose.

[39:13] And then I also added some panning rotation.

[39:16] And then I kind of mapped all of this

[39:18] to a time stretcher node.

[39:20] So again, this node is to make like speed warps and stuff.

[39:24] And in the tutorial, again, Casey Ferris,

[39:26] which I mentioned before,

[39:27] showed how you can press equal

[39:30] and then JavaScript developers will understand that.

[39:33] Each frame has a reference called time.

[39:37] So if you just go time,

[39:38] it's gonna be the normal frame.

[39:40] Each frame is its own frame.

[39:41] But you could go floor, like math.floor in JavaScript.

[39:45] So it's gonna bring it back down

[39:46] to the nearest round integer.

[39:49] And so the function was like flow

[39:52] and then time divided by 3.5.

[39:55] And so every 3.5 frames, it would freeze,

[39:58] bring it back down always

[40:00] because it hasn't reached the next one.

[40:02] And then you multiply it by 3.5 again,

[40:04] so it doesn't slow motion.

[40:06] So it goes at the normal speed,

[40:08] but it kind of holds back for 3.5 frames.

[40:11] And then it jumps to the next one.

[40:13] And so you have this effect.

[40:16] And then typically you would expose that as a prop,

[40:18] as like the jitter speed.

[40:21] And you could have a slider from zero to whatever.

[40:24] And if you go zero, it's like completely fluid.

[40:26] And if you go to 24, it's just one frame per second.

[40:29] And then you can,

[40:30] I find amazing that you can just write a little function

[40:33] that you have the time as a variable,

[40:35] and then you can do whatever math function

[40:38] just with the flow of,

[40:39] like you can have these expressions,

[40:41] which is the Lua.

[40:42] I haven't even looked into it,

[40:44] but if you know Java,

[40:44] like it's a programming language.

[40:46] You can do math and stuff really intuitively.

[40:50] And the fact that you can right click on any field

[40:52] and pass an expression

[40:54] instead of just the values that are offered to you.

[40:57] So you can tie it to another field and say,

[40:59] take this field, follow this SVD path,

[41:01] but then just add like variability.

[41:03] Like it's crazy.

[41:04] You can do anything you want.

[41:05] - They actually have like an API as well

[41:09] for DaVinci Resolve.

[41:10] I started writing like a script

[41:12] that could do a bunch of the kind of,

[41:15] the preparing of a project

[41:18] that I do when I create a new project.

[41:20] And so I automated the process of like,

[41:23] like I click a button

[41:25] and then it like creates a new project

[41:28] with a particular resolution and frame rate.

[41:30] It drags in the media,

[41:32] it creates proxy media so I can edit it really quickly.

[41:37] And yeah, and I think did the audio transcription as well.

[41:42] It like triggered off a whole bunch of tasks

[41:44] so I could just like drop a whole bunch of media in a folder

[41:46] and click a button and then just walk away.

[41:47] And when I come back,

[41:48] I'm actually ready to start editing this video.

[41:52] So yeah, it's really cool that they,

[41:54] yeah, DaVinci Resolve kind of exposing these ways

[41:57] to write like code in your video editing software.

[42:01] That's nuts.

[42:03] - From the beginning, I think, correct me if I'm wrong,

[42:05] but I think it uses Postgres database to store all your,

[42:09] it's definitely a database,

[42:10] but I think it's Postgres, yeah.

[42:12] So it's a bit intimidating when you start to like,

[42:14] oh, create your database and like,

[42:15] oh, I just want to edit a video,

[42:17] but you just have to give it a folder

[42:19] and then it's going to store all these databases.

[42:22] And then it stores XML and it's all programmery.

[42:25] It's basically like a really elegant UI control stuff,

[42:28] like Webflow, but for video editing, I guess.

[42:31] - It's insane.

[42:32] And I think, let us know in the comments and whatever,

[42:36] if we, I think we should do a whole episode on Resolve

[42:39] 'cause we both use it

[42:40] and it's really, really amazing piece of software.

[42:43] And we haven't mentioned it's completely free.

[42:46] - It's insane.

[42:47] - It's ridiculous.

[42:48] - It's free.

[42:49] Like it's nuts.

[42:50] Like there is a paid version.

[42:51] I think both of us have the paid version now,

[42:53] which gives you access to like a couple of like AI features

[42:56] and stuff, but like everything we were just talking about,

[42:58] like the whole thing is free.

[43:03] Like, it's not like they give you access

[43:04] to like this, you know, very beginner.

[43:07] - With a watermark or yeah.

[43:09] - Yeah, and it's not like a timed trial

[43:11] or anything like that.

[43:12] The whole thing is free,

[43:13] but then there are a couple of like really, you know,

[43:16] niche tools that they add on top

[43:19] that are just the things that like cost them money to run.

[43:22] So like, you know, AI transcription of scripts

[43:25] and stuff like that.

[43:27] And yeah, there are just like very few small,

[43:30] very, very pro features that you can purchase

[43:35] by buying the software,

[43:37] but you can edit Hollywood level movies

[43:40] with completely the free version.

[43:42] Like nothing is holding you back, it's nuts.

[43:44] - A friend of mine kept recommending it.

[43:46] And I was like, in my head, I was always thinking,

[43:49] yeah, it's going to be like 15,000.

[43:51] Like the whole Adobe Premiere Suite,

[43:53] if you buy it off the right, like not the subscription.

[43:56] I was like, I don't have money.

[43:57] I want a free tool.

[43:58] And one day he said, dude, I keep telling you it is free.

[44:02] And in my head, I was like, yeah,

[44:03] but watermark three export in 480.

[44:06] - Or like, it's going to be like the iMovie version

[44:09] and really you need like Final Cut to do anything real.

[44:12] - And I tried the free and I was blown away.

[44:15] If you've seen any of my YouTube videos

[44:18] on the Tailwind Labs channel,

[44:19] and it's all the free resolve,

[44:20] and I barely scratched the surface.

[44:22] Like it's, this is why we're going to make an episode.

[44:25] And in the episode, we will reveal to you

[44:27] how they can make it free,

[44:29] because it's like a really strange business model,

[44:31] but it's a good one.

[44:33] - And this is also why we can't do 30 minute episodes.

[44:36] (laughs)

[44:37] Simon is too excited about the things

[44:38] that he wants to sick pick.

[44:40] (laughs)

[44:41] - And now for John Mayer's sick pick.

[44:43] (laughs)

[44:44] - My sick pick this week is to learn to make sourdough

[44:47] or like any kind of bread.

[44:48] I just like bread.

[44:49] There's something special about it.

[44:51] It like connects you to, you know,

[44:54] it connects you to the ingredients that you're making.

[44:57] And there's just something about sourdough.

[45:00] Like the process is quite,

[45:02] like it's not a super complicated bread,

[45:05] but there are so many steps where you can go wrong

[45:09] just by changing something a tiny, tiny little amount.

[45:12] And so like, it is a super simple bread.

[45:16] It's got super simple ingredients.

[45:17] And like the process is like that each step is quite simple,

[45:23] but yeah, it just like everything needs to be done

[45:26] in the correct way.

[45:27] And I feel like you learn so many techniques

[45:30] about baking and bread stuff,

[45:33] and like the strength of dough and different flours

[45:36] that you should use and stuff like that.

[45:38] It's just, it's a really satisfying thing

[45:40] when you get it right.

[45:42] And so I got really into making sourdough

[45:44] during the COVID lockdown.

[45:47] And so I couldn't go anywhere,

[45:49] couldn't go to any of the nice bakeries

[45:51] that were just outside of our area

[45:54] that we were allowed to go.

[45:56] And so, yeah, I started like learning how to make sourdough

[46:00] and I got to like a certain level and I didn't,

[46:03] like it kind of just the interest fell off eventually.

[46:06] And then I tried to make some

[46:07] after not making some for years,

[46:09] and it just went terribly wrong

[46:12] because I didn't have all of those techniques

[46:14] fresh in my mind and all those little bits.

[46:16] - Yeah.

[46:18] That compounding care that you give sourdough over time,

[46:22] 'cause it takes like three days to make a loaf of sourdough

[46:24] or really it takes like three months

[46:27] to make a loaf of sourdough

[46:29] because you've got to like develop a sourdough culture.

[46:33] You've got to develop like the bacteria

[46:35] that's like the yeast that, you know,

[46:39] that eats the bread and creates that like sour flavor.

[46:44] So it's this like really long process.

[46:47] And so when you get to the end

[46:48] and you actually have like bread that worked out

[46:51] and you did it correctly and like you understand

[46:54] all the little bits that need to go into it,

[46:57] it's just so satisfying

[46:59] and it's such a delicious type of bread.

[47:01] And it's so nice to like share with friends,

[47:03] take it to a dinner party or whatever it's.

[47:06] Yeah, it's amazing.

[47:07] And so I recommend you go and learn how to make sourdough

[47:12] and go and watch the YouTube videos on it.

[47:15] And even if it seems ridiculous,

[47:18] each of these like little things that they're doing,

[47:20] like, come on, that's not gonna make a difference.

[47:21] The sum of all of those little things

[47:23] makes a huge difference

[47:25] and it's really satisfying and really-

[47:26] - If you have the dials right, this is-

[47:28] - Yeah, it's really therapeutic to go through this like,

[47:31] this whole process and get to the end

[47:33] where you have this very delicious bread.

[47:35] - Yeah, it turns out-

[47:36] - But actually don't eat all of it yourself

[47:38] over and over again,

[47:39] because that's not a good idea to eat that much bread.

[47:42] - Do it for sharing, yes.

[47:43] - That's right, yeah.

[47:44] So take it to the dinner party or like make it for the kids.

[47:48] Like, yeah, share it.

[47:49] It's a sharing bread.

[47:51] It's not an eat an entire loaf yourself bread, yeah.

[47:54] - I really like what you say about the longer

[47:57] and more care and craft and learning and failure

[48:00] and then getting good at it it takes,

[48:02] the more joyful the experience is at the end.

[48:05] Like it's, there's something to be said about like,

[48:08] people wanna take shortcuts and do stuff

[48:10] they nail on the first try.

[48:12] But if you speak to someone like Jalen Brown

[48:14] or Jason Tatum from the Boston Celtics for eight years,

[48:18] they've been-

[48:19] - The champion of the NBA final.

[48:21] We still need to do an episode on basketball

[48:24] to lose all of our listeners.

[48:25] - But before they won,

[48:27] and the same happened with the Golden State,

[48:29] where before they won and Jordan's Bulls,

[48:31] like that seven or eight years of failing,

[48:34] getting so close and then,

[48:35] oh, we need a little bit more three-point shooting,

[48:37] tightening up the defense and then the adjustments.

[48:40] Concessions, there's people that brought them almost there

[48:43] and got traded to bring the last piece

[48:45] that allowed them to win the championship.

[48:47] On that note, I don't wanna make it longer,

[48:49] but I love how the coach, the Boston Celtics coach said,

[48:53] "We won with this team today."

[48:55] There's players like Marcus Smart and other people

[48:57] that have left the team literally last year.

[49:00] And they also won the championship in a way

[49:03] because there's no way we get there

[49:05] without their contributions and helping us figure out

[49:08] what's the last week.

[49:09] Do I add a bit more yeast to the temperature for the bread?

[49:12] At what time do I add the beer

[49:13] or whatever you put in there?

[49:15] It's really all these things that together bring you

[49:18] to the final result that you can really enjoy

[49:21] and share with everyone.

[49:23] - Yeah, yeah, love it.

[49:24] And I will definitely make you some sourdough

[49:27] if you ever come to Melbourne

[49:28] or if I come up and visit in Sydney.

[49:30] - Not Sydney, six hours further.

[49:33] - Sydney-ish, New South Wales, Northern New South Wales.

[49:36] - Yeah, small state.

[49:39] - Yeah.

[49:39] - All right, look at us, 15 minutes.

[49:41] We have done all the things.

[49:42] We can wrap up.

[49:43] - It's the shortest episode we've done.

[49:44] We were aiming for 30.

[49:45] We got to 50, but we've definitely improved

[49:49] or reduced the amount of time we take for an episode.

[49:51] So thank you so much for listening

[49:53] and we will see you again next week.

[49:54] - See you next week.

[49:55] Thanks for tuning in.

[49:56] Let us know what you feel about the comments

[49:58] and see you soon.

[50:00] Bye.

[50:01] you

[50:03] you
