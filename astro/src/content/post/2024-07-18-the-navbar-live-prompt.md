## Transcript

[00:00] think. Welcome to The Nav Bar. We are live on Twitch, YouTube and Twitter. And I almost thought

[00:07] that John had frozen, but he's very concentrated. Oh yeah, no, sorry. I'm just sharing the link out

[00:12] on Twitter. That's what's got my concentrated face on. We can start the podcast bit separate

[00:20] to the live bit. Welcome to the live viewers. Hello. Hello. We were just talking about all the

[00:26] things that we want to do, all of the ways we want to tweak The Nav Bar as we always do. Look

[00:31] at this beautiful layout that Simon's got. Definitely just for the live people. Actually,

[00:35] no, because one of the things we were talking about is we're going to start putting these out

[00:38] as videos, both on embedded tweets and also YouTube and stuff. And so people will actually

[00:44] be able to see this beautiful layout that Simon has prepared. Exactly. My turn to pause because

[00:52] I heard children in my backyard and my family is not supposed to be here. So if my neighbors just

[00:58] come and start playing basketball because we have a basketball hoop and it's very community vibe

[01:02] feel around here. Nice. I can hear stuff. I can hear stuff. If you're joining us in the chat,

[01:12] let us know if you can hear. Simon reckons he has lawnmowers going, he's got dogs barking,

[01:17] and now he reckons he has kids in the background. So let us know if you can hear any of those

[01:21] things because I can't. I think it's all in his head. We'll see. The dogs will understand.

[01:32] Stop barking. I'm recording a podcast. Simon, Simon, Simon. Well, thanks for joining us on

[01:41] the live stream to watch me, uh, you know, try to work out what to do by myself. So this is Simon's

[01:49] beautiful layout that he's put together. Uh, he's got the welcome to the navbar page up. And so this

[01:54] is our website, which you can go and check out at navbar.tech, I think. No, navbar dot, uh,

[02:02] I can't see it at the top. I'm pretty sure it's navbar.tech. Let's see. Oh, not tej.tech. It is

[02:11] in fact navbar.tech. And you can see a list of all of the episodes that we've done so far. Well,

[02:18] the funny thing is that episode 23. Hello. Hey puppy. So flex is joining us for the,

[02:28] for the podcast. I'm out of breath now. The best way to make the dog stop barking is to take him

[02:32] in here. So neighbor's mowing and they have their grandchildren and they're running around

[02:37] and screaming. And so my dogs and their dogs and every dog. So Simon's just taking me off

[02:43] the podcast entirely. That's fine. First he leaves me alone in the podcast and then he takes over.

[02:49] There we go. Hello. This is T-Rex. Oh, T-Rex. Oh, look at the T-Rex arms. Oh,

[02:55] look at those little arms. You know, Caro and I, my wife and I have been watching,

[02:59] uh, like for no reason at all. We've been watching all of the Jurassic Park movies. Yep. And so we,

[03:05] we started with like the original trilogy, which gets way worse as you, as you go. The first movie

[03:11] is awesome. Second movie is okay. Third movie, not good at all. Uh, but then we just started

[03:16] like watching all the new ones as well. And yeah, they're, they're okay. Yeah. Not great.

[03:22] That happens a lot with movies. The sequels kind of nosedive at some point.

[03:26] Yeah. Yeah. So I think there's six of them all up. So we're, we're determined to get through

[03:32] all of them. Yeah. So the reason I've built this super fancy layout here, if I go back to the

[03:39] screen share is that, uh, first of all, you should check the knife bar website. If you haven't, uh,

[03:46] there's a few episodes we have to add here, but there's so many, that's what I was just about to

[03:50] say. I think this one is like episode 30 and the last one there is episode 23. So I'm sorry,

[03:56] everyone. I will get these uploaded. I've actually like they're edited now. I just need to go through

[04:01] and do a last like export and upload. And we're good to go. So I will, like I say, every week,

[04:07] I'll totally do it this week. I will find the time to add those episodes.

[04:12] Yes. It's like the, the comments to do refactor later.

[04:16] It's just like the show notes every week. I make big promises, things that will be in

[04:20] the show notes, things that will be on the website. Yeah. But the other reason I did this

[04:25] is because, um, John built an incredible website recently. I don't know if you know about it.

[04:34] It's almost as well styled as, as Simon's. Oh no. The number up the top is yeah. Okay. There

[04:39] we go. There we go. So we need to start the episode. What's the number at the top?

[04:44] Oh, the, the number of viewers in mine, I can see the number of people in that.

[04:49] 34.

[04:50] Yeah. 6,850,000. Uh, and that's being blocked by the, uh, oh, that's blocking.

[04:56] Oh yeah. It's not, it's not, it's blocking your UI, but not the viewers.

[05:00] And I'm sure it's, I'm sure everywhere else. It's fine.

[05:02] Go back to the other one and let's start the podcast on that one.

[05:07] I think I'm, um, uh, we've reached the, the, the part of the relationship where I'm starting to

[05:12] annoy John because I, I'm just want to muck around and be funny. And he likes the structure,

[05:17] like he wants the official start, take a deeper, welcome to the nav bar.

[05:23] You can see it's starting to eat at me. When does the actual podcast start? How do we do this?

[05:29] We're just hanging. This is a podcast, man. We like, yes, there's the audio version, but like,

[05:34] I like the, the idea of like making the live stuff more of a equal parts with the, I know you don't.

[05:41] And anyone who was listening to last week where Simon said, we need to start shortening the

[05:46] episodes so that we can like get this done quickly. This is, this is what he does in the

[05:51] next episode. It's just, let's have a, let's have a whole podcast before the podcast.

[05:55] Man, human stuff. I like it. I like it. I like it too. You should leave that in the audio version.

[06:03] I don't. Yeah. Whatever. If you think people listening to the podcast want to just like the

[06:08] factual official serious stuff, maybe the, I don't know. I like, I, I use, I compare a lot with Aaron

[06:14] and Ian Lansman's podcast, and I love how they just talk about HVAC and random stuff. And it's.

[06:20] Oh yeah, no, we can talk about random stuff. We just have to do this first.

[06:23] Okay. Welcome to the NavBar podcast. Thank you for joining us for another week. My name's John.

[06:28] This is Simon. Let's go. What are we doing this week?

[06:30] What are we doing this week? Well, first of all, I have to make an announcement. I have launched

[06:35] my epic web dev pixel perfect Figma to Tailwind.

[06:39] Awesome. I have been so excited for this for a very, very long time.

[06:45] How has the launch been going so far? It's been going great. I have learned

[06:50] my mistake from last time where I launched Pro Tailwind and I did all this work. And then I

[06:54] launched and I was like, job done. I've launched. I can just forget about it and do some other stuff.

[07:00] And now it's going just to magically sell by itself. Actually, when you launch is the, just

[07:04] the start of the, like, everyone's like, congrats, what are you going to start doing that you've

[07:08] launched? I was like, well, work on the launch. And basically, yeah, it's like the launch is like

[07:13] the tip of the iceberg and then everything else underneath it is like, oh, why are we,

[07:19] for anyone watching the, oh, nevermind. That's completely in my head. That was on the local

[07:25] recording. When I did that heart, Apple did its little heart thing, but I haven't frozen.

[07:32] So that's good for anyone that didn't join last week or hasn't listened to that episode.

[07:36] Uh, we had, or every episode we've had problems with, uh, the built-in MacOS, uh, like gesture

[07:43] detection. And so when we do a gesture, it just like freezes the camera. Um, and you need to

[07:49] turn it off for every application. So great. To name a few, uh, Scott Tolinski, Wes Boss,

[07:55] and Ken C Dodds also got burned by this in the recent weeks. So it's, it's definitely a thing,

[08:00] even season, uh, people used to record stuff and produce stuff. I get caught with that

[08:05] even after turning it off and it just somehow comes back. This is the closest we got from

[08:10] John dropping a swear word on the pod. I get them all out before we hit, before we hit record.

[08:20] Simon tells me just before we're going to record, all right, clean it up. No more swearing. We're

[08:24] going to put this out as a clean podcast. And so, uh, I'm very, I'm very well behaved once,

[08:29] once we go live. Yes. So let me just finish my thought and then we can move to the actual topic

[08:34] of today. I promise. Uh, yes, last time I launched and then I let it go in a launch is kind of like,

[08:39] you've got this wave and then it goes away inevitably. And the idea is to try to keep

[08:44] riding that wave and just do little pushes to, to maintain the, kind of like the retention on

[08:49] YouTube video. Like once it drops, you've, you've lost people. And so basically I've sent, uh,

[08:54] emails with like new, I've produced basically one YouTube video per day since it launched

[09:01] instead of just retiring on an Island. And I just kind of emailed this with the, an article

[09:06] and the video and then it'll call to action. Hey, by the way, if you like this, you can check out

[09:11] this course and I'm just going to do the plug. Now there's six hours left before the 20% launch

[09:16] discount of goes to normal pricing. So if you haven't checked it out, six hours, hurry right

[09:23] now, go to epicweb.dev and then you will find the little banner at the top. Uh, the, the workshop's

[09:29] called pixel perfect tailwinds. And we design, we take a Figma design and make it pixel perfect.

[09:36] So it's responsive. It's a pretty cool stuff. Yeah. Right. It is. It is an amazing workshop.

[09:43] And yeah, it's like the, the preparation that goes into putting a course together. It's like,

[09:48] like the, the release is like the tip of the iceberg, but underneath that, that big mound

[09:52] underneath is like all the preparation beforehand, like half of it's probably the preparation before,

[09:58] maybe more than that. But then there's like this huge chunk of actually like marketing it

[10:02] afterwards. Cause you can, you can put out the most amazing thing in the world, but if you don't

[10:06] get it out to people, if you don't reach people that are interested in, in, in learning about

[10:11] tailwinds, then like, you know, that's, that's a lot of time that you put into something that,

[10:16] that just kind of flops. And so there's so much work that needs to go into,

[10:20] you know, getting that message out there. So people know that the course actually exists.

[10:25] And don't feel bad for sharing things a couple of times. I've spammed my course like for a whole

[10:29] week. Kent C. Doggs with like a massive audience have spammed on Twitter as well and emailed his

[10:35] whole entire mailing list. And then the other day he made a little poll, like, Hey, did you know

[10:40] Simon has a workshop? Yes, no. And there's about 35% people said no. And I was like, like, I feel

[10:46] like I'm going to get canceled for like just abusing, sharing the same thing over and over.

[10:51] And there's still people on Twitter that follow Kent and me, and they didn't know. And it's like.

[10:57] Yeah. And just, just for some perspective, like I've probably only seen, like I've seen one tweet

[11:02] from Kent and maybe two tweets from you that have gone through my feed. And so like, I'm pretty

[11:06] active in liking and sharing all of your stuff. And so the fact that I'm seeing so few things means

[11:12] you could be repeating yourself a lot more. That's something that I learned when I, when I started at

[11:17] Superbase, I used to like, you know, once I had put out the tweet, I was like, well, I've done

[11:21] the tweet. And so that's done. I can't, I can't do that again. And yeah, the person that I was

[11:26] working with at that point, thankfully challenged that idea and was like, no, you can like put out

[11:31] the, like, not, not exactly the same tweet, like restructure it. Like, don't, don't just say the

[11:35] thing again, but you can say the same thing in a different way, like five or 10 times. And yeah,

[11:43] it's not going to annoy people and it's just going to keep reaching new people that didn't see the

[11:47] original stuff anyway. And it's a nice, because making new videos or new little tips or contents

[11:52] is a nice way to bring people back to the same thing with a fresh, new idea. And the first,

[11:57] my first idea was to do, oh, I'll do a quick tip on design tokens in Tailwind and how you can map

[12:02] them to background colors, text colors. And the next thing, you know, I did a 32 video workshop,

[12:07] like to promote my paid workshop. I made the exact same similar structured workshop, but for free.

[12:14] And it's like, it's not as long, but it's like a whole day workshop. Lots of exercise, 32 videos,

[12:19] I've recorded everything I have to edit now, but it went from a, hey, let's do a quick five

[12:24] minute video to, oh, I could structure it in six, seven lessons to, oh, problem solution sequence.

[12:29] And the next thing, you know, I've built a whole app, a workshop app with like problem blog posts,

[12:36] links to, anyway, it's going to be all free and it's taking me hundreds of hours to produce.

[12:42] And when you talk about the tip of the iceberg, this is, that's the thing under that's not going

[12:46] to make me any money directly, but hopefully people look at it and then there's a link to

[12:51] the paid one. And they're like, oh, Simon Karma points. Let's support the guy. Very, very cool.

[12:57] And with that, everyone that follows the rules, Simon says, purchase the course.

[13:01] Yes. And when I say, when Simon says, it's not me, don't listen to me, but listen to Simon.

[13:06] When Simon says you got to do it, you've been, you've been raised that way. You know,

[13:13] you just have to, you showed me something very cool that you're working on to get some of these

[13:18] tips out there. Is that something we're allowed to talk about? What did I show you? I showed

[13:23] you a lot of things. You showed me like a tailwind tips thing that you had been working on.

[13:28] Oh yeah. Yeah. That's public. Yeah. Sick. Tell us about it. The little toots thing.

[13:34] Yeah. Yeah. Tell us about tailwind toots. So I've always, exactly what I've just told you, like I,

[13:43] I started with a little idea and it turned into a full day workshop and it's taking hundreds of

[13:50] hours to produce. And every time I make a video, I think it's going to be two, three minutes and

[13:54] it turned into 27 minutes. And I'm like, I would love a really simple format, like a mini, mini

[13:59] tutorial. Uh, like it's almost like Tik Tok or YouTube shorts, like less than one minute.

[14:06] And there's vertical only. And it's like, just for the Gen Z sort of like super high energy.

[14:12] And I'm not teaching you deep topics. I just pick one tiny thing, like eggheads,

[14:16] shortened down egghead, if you think. And I was like, Oh, mini toots, tailwind shorts,

[14:21] tailwind clips. Uh, and just as a joke, because I remember there was, uh, well, like,

[14:29] there was a lot of controversy in the tailwind world at some point because someone compared,

[14:34] uh, tailwind to a fart in a blog post that got very, very, very popular because it was

[14:38] shared by... It is a tailwind, like... Yes. So I thought I'd take that twist of the people

[14:45] comparing to the fart and make it kind of fun. And I, I was like, tailwind toots kind of sounds

[14:49] funny. But then I realized that tutorial, uh, it's a mini toots. And, um, I, I, I just did for fun,

[14:57] a little motion graphics intro and it looked so cool. I was like, Oh crap, this is cool. This

[15:02] is actually cool. And I bought it the main name and I've thought I'm going to make it a little

[15:06] series. Um, yeah. It is awesome. So go and check out tailwind-toots.com. It is a lot of fun. And

[15:17] are you planning to put a whole bunch of tailwind toots on there? I have already failed, but the

[15:23] idea is to do one per day because they literally take me... The intro took me about one or two

[15:28] hours to do. Uh, but the, the execution on the, on the actual videos, uh, because they're like

[15:38] really short, it actually takes me only about five minutes to record and 20 minutes to edit,

[15:43] I guess. Uh, I'll just, I don't know if the sound's going to come through, but I'll play one.

[15:47] Uh, if you, if you're not, if you're listening, you're missing out. And if you're here, you can

[15:50] see. Oh, I can't quite hear. See, there's a fantastic little fart noise there, uh, that you

[15:59] just missed. Yeah. So if you, if you can't see that basically like there's a little stop motion

[16:05] intro and there's a tailwind logo that comes and then it makes a playful confetti fart and moves

[16:11] out of the way and then the short intro starts. Uh, and yeah, I mean, I think this is going to

[16:19] be fun because it's something that I can consistently do. Uh, I've done it for two

[16:23] days back to back and then I failed already because I'm producing the workshop launch

[16:28] because it's the last day, but I'll go back to it every time I have a super simple idea.

[16:31] The first one is literally, um, uh, I forgot what it is, but it's like a super tiny little

[16:37] thing that you, that you can explain in five seconds. I think the second one is talking about

[16:41] gap. And so how you can use grid and the gap property that, uh, will then make things in

[16:48] a list respect things like margin and padding and things. Yeah. So I think the smallest possible

[16:52] scope, like if I'm, if I'm building something and I realize, oh, maybe people don't know,

[16:57] but you can bake in the opacity of a color by doing slash 30 for 30% opacity instead of going

[17:03] BG green 500 and then BG opacity 30. And I just do a tip on that and it takes five seconds and

[17:09] it's like a 15 second clip with the intro and the, and it's, it's really cool. And the idea is that

[17:14] this is the sort of stuff people like and share because it's very tweetable and like friendly

[17:20] and fun and still informative. And I can, I can do one a day without freaking out. Yes.

[17:25] You asked me to talk about this. No. And in terms of like knowledge,

[17:30] like you are like the person who probably like you probably like, okay, Adam might know more about

[17:37] like the, the actual like design of tailwind, but you've probably used tailwind more than Adam has.

[17:44] Like you, you are the, like the pinnacle of education in terms of, of, of tailwind. And so

[17:51] all of those little bits of nuggets of things, like your brain would just be filled with them.

[17:56] There'd be so many things that you would take for granted that you think that people know about

[18:00] tailwind just because you've been doing it for years. That's exactly right. So the, yeah, that's

[18:06] the sort of stuff that people pick up on a video that I do. Oh, I had no, like in the workshops,

[18:10] they say, Oh, I didn't know you could do this. I'm like, Oh, that's like a one-on-one thing for me,

[18:16] but it makes sense. And then like, this is the sort of tips I want to do. Just go through the

[18:21] docs and like anything that I'm like, Oh yeah, this thing, not everyone knows, little toots.

[18:25] Yeah. I'm excited. It needs to be a way you can subscribe to them. So I get notified every time

[18:32] there's a new toot. Yeah. They're just like notifications and on, on your computer, it just

[18:39] makes a little fart noise. There's a new tailwind toot out. There you go. Instead of the stripe

[18:45] sales, like, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's right. Yeah. Would you like to talk about the thing

[18:51] that you've built as well? I would love to talk about the extreme amount of effort that I've gone

[18:58] in to build the thing that I've built, uh, last night at about 10 30 PM, I was like, Oh, that's

[19:04] right. On the next episode of the nav bar, we're going to do a, uh, a stumped episode, essentially

[19:11] a stumped inspired episode. So syntax and a whole bunch of other podcasts have this, uh, this format

[19:18] where, um, you like, I will ask Simon a like web development interview question, uh, and then we'll

[19:26] see how he does in answering it. And then he's going to ask me a question and we'll go back and

[19:30] forth. Uh, it's just a fun way to, to break up the podcast a little bit and, uh, do a little bit

[19:35] of a, a game. So I was like, well, we need some questions. And so I found a GitHub repo, which

[19:41] will be in the show notes that had a whole list. It was, it was the one with the most stars, um,

[19:49] in front end interview questions. And so it had just a big Markdown file of a whole bunch of

[19:55] HTML, CSS, and JavaScript questions. And so I, uh, copied those Markdown files and then built a new

[20:03] Astro app just because it was going to be super fast to do it this way. Um, and so I added, uh,

[20:10] the, these Markdown files and then just created a separate page for JavaScript, HTML, and CSS that

[20:14] pulls from that particular Markdown file. And it just converts the big Markdown list into a Jason

[20:20] list and then picks a random question from that list. So when you click either JavaScript, HTML,

[20:25] or CSS, uh, it will navigate to that page and give you a new question. So you can just keep

[20:31] clicking CSS and it will just keep giving you a fresh interview question every time.

[20:36] - Is that using the new Astro actions and servers?

[20:40] - It doesn't need to use any actions. This is all just like server side stuff. And so, yeah,

[20:44] it is a, um, a dynamic application. So the output in the Astro config needs to be set to server,

[20:52] which means that every page is loaded on the server. It's doing SSR stuff rather than statically

[20:58] generated entirely, uh, static content, um, which is obviously necessary because we want to keep

[21:05] loading a new question every time we navigate to that page. So if we, if we didn't set that

[21:09] configuration, then it would load it once and then that would be it. It would just stick with that,

[21:14] which is exactly what happened when I pushed it to production, because I forgot that that's

[21:18] something that I need to do to make things dynamic. And so I set that config, uh, and then

[21:23] I forgot that I don't, that I need to include a Vercel adapter to, to actually run that server

[21:30] stuff. And so I did that and now it's a beautiful site with absolutely zero CSS. It doesn't even

[21:38] like, this is probably the first project in like three years that hasn't included Tailwind. And

[21:43] so it even has the terrible default styling of the browser that like serif font. That's just.

[21:49] - Yeah. It's beautiful. You can see there's a body tag and then just hrefs anchor tags inside.

[21:55] - That's all you need.

[21:56] - Yep. Like it.

[21:58] - All right, Simon, are you ready?

[22:00] - I've added some things that we should add as categories, but so far that's just like,

[22:06] if I refresh the page, they're going to go. Yeah. So we thought that'd be fun to kind of

[22:11] expose ourselves and make sure we never get another job ever anywhere else by,

[22:15] by being fraudulent on live streams on three platforms. Good idea.

[22:20] - As you can hear, Simon's feeling a little, a little anxious about this,

[22:23] a little anxious about exposing his, his lack of knowledge over these categories. So

[22:28] I think he's going to be fine. And also I think it's, you know, it helps humanize the whole thing

[22:34] and make other people feel like they don't need to know everything in the entire world,

[22:37] because I'm sure there's stuff that we're not going to know as well.

[22:39] - Yeah. And the reason it's on screen. So like, if you're listening, we have the website and

[22:45] there's three buttons, JavaScript, HTML, CSS. And when I click on one, according to John,

[22:49] it's going to pull up a question so we can take turns. Do we...

[22:53] - Simon's pretending he didn't just stay up all night reading every single one to make sure that

[22:57] he had a prepared answer. I've never seen this website in my life. What is this? What's going

[23:02] to happen when I click these buttons? - I got all my notes here.

[23:05] - He's ready to go. So yeah, I think we need to add a Tailwind one in there that has some like

[23:13] proper stumping questions for Tailwind. And we need to add SQL or some kind of like

[23:18] database-y stuff, which you can try and stump me on. I'm sure you will easily stump me on.

[23:22] So would you like to go first, Simon? - Yeah. We got about seven, eight minutes

[23:27] in a half an hour window. I think it's cool to do like a test run of this and then we can do

[23:31] a whole episode. So how do we go? Do we get to choose who, like if I choose a category and then

[23:41] you ask, how do we go? - I guess I get to choose

[23:43] the category and then you ask me the question. So how about we go with trusty old JavaScript?

[23:47] - Oh, start with JavaScript. Okay. - No, you're asking me a question,

[23:51] so it's going to be okay. - Yeah. I zoomed in a lot,

[23:54] so I don't know how big the text is going to go. Hey, perfect. What is the definition of a higher

[24:00] order function? - Okay. I haven't written a

[24:04] higher order function in a long time or the React pattern that was inspired by it, which is a higher

[24:09] order component. I haven't written one of those in years. I used to write a lot of them. And so I

[24:16] probably can't actually explain this. So a higher order function is simply just a function that

[24:21] returns another function. So it's a function that you can call, you pass it parameters or whatever,

[24:27] and it will return you a function that you can then call later. And so this is a way that you

[24:32] can kind of have like some like secret config-y stuff, or it doesn't necessarily have to be

[24:39] secret, but some kind of like configuration stuff that you need to do to the function that you don't

[24:43] want the user to have to write a whole bunch of stuff to do. So an example from coming from the

[24:48] Superbase side, we do a lot of like handling auth stuff for you. And so there's a lot of stuff in

[24:56] Superbase where you call a function and you get back another function, and that's something that

[25:00] you can call later to see whether the user is signed in or not. That would be a good example

[25:04] of a higher order function. - Wow.

[25:06] - What do you think, Simon? Because there's one part that's missing from this, because I just

[25:12] cobbled it together very quickly last night, is that it doesn't actually have the answers. So I

[25:17] guess we just need to... Well, I guess now there's another level to the game.

[25:20] - I was about to say that. - You need to decide,

[25:23] was that answer correct enough? And so part of the game is that I need to sound confident enough

[25:29] that even if I'm completely making it up, it sounds accurate enough that you give me the point.

[25:33] - I just realized, as you started answering, I was like, "Oh, I'm asking myself the question

[25:38] because I'm going to have to confirm or deny." I think you did a good job. And you mentioned that

[25:44] in React, it used to be a pattern. So before, now we have hooks that kind of let you add,

[25:50] augment a component with functionality. And before that, there was the render prop pattern,

[25:55] which lets you pass some things to a component. And even before that, there was this higher order

[26:00] component thing where you would have a component and then you're like, "Oh, I wish we had access

[26:04] to more stuff." And it would do a few things here and there that we don't need to replicate every

[26:08] time. So you would have a component that adds this thing and then returns the other components.

[26:13] So like you said, React components are really function calls. So it's a function that wraps

[26:18] some config and functionality and then passes it to the next thing that the user consumes. And so

[26:23] when they consume that, it comes with the banana in the jungle around it sort of stuff.

[26:27] >> That's right. There was function as a child component. And there were all these crazy patterns

[26:35] to do this kind of handling some of that stuff somewhere else and giving you a simple interface

[26:42] to just use it. >> And they needed to be another

[26:45] component because to be able to set props and do anything, you needed a component unit.

[26:50] And that's where hooks kind of came. And they were like, "Oh, you don't need to return anything.

[26:54] You just do the logic and then you use that hook in your function." And so you're like,

[26:59] "Oh, are you telling me I don't need to have a whole UI components that returns

[27:03] nothing just to have some logic that I pass to something else?" Then hooks became like,

[27:07] "You just take the thing you want to augment with and write it as basically a JavaScript function

[27:12] that starts with use. And then you can use that inside your component instead of passing it from

[27:18] another component as an arrow function where the props get accessed." And yeah.

[27:21] >> It just shows you how clever people will be. You give them a couple of tools and they will

[27:29] create these insane patterns to do really complex things. And some of those catch on and some of

[27:36] them don't. And then obviously all of these patterns inspired things that obviously were

[27:41] lacking like hooks, which are now some form of that is in every component library or every web

[27:48] development framework. >> You mentioned Kent C. Dodds.

[27:51] I want to say, I think the render prop pattern was... It existed probably. I don't think Kent

[27:57] invented it, but it got popularized very, very bigly with his downshift library, which was

[28:04] basically a way to do combo box, drop down, whatever, without any headless style. And

[28:10] basically it gave you the primitive and all the logic. And then you would be able to just do the

[28:15] front end by consuming this. And it was, I think it was all, not the higher order function, but the

[28:20] render prop pattern. So you have this crazy syntax where the child of the component is actually a

[28:27] function that returns and you can restructure the props there and then use them inside there.

[28:33] That's how I discovered the render prop pattern. >> That's a great example of like, yeah, all that

[28:38] configuration is done for you. There's so much stuff that a combo box needs to do. And for you

[28:44] to copy and paste that from the docs, there's a huge amount of code for something to go wrong.

[28:49] Whereas if you just consume this library, it does all of that for you and then just gives

[28:56] you the opportunity to tell it how you want to style it. And so it's taking one of those concerns

[29:00] away and doing all of that config or all of that logic, and then just giving you the bit that you

[29:05] want to be unique for your app, which is where do we get the results from and what does it look like

[29:10] on the page? >> Exactly. That's headless UI in a nutshell. If you use headless UI speaking,

[29:15] literally headless UI library, they use the render prop pattern. And if you use something like React

[29:20] area, it came a bit later. It's very hooks driven. You have use accessibility keyboard navigation.

[29:28] There's all these use hooks. And then you can compose anything. You literally just write CSS

[29:35] and apply styles to this thing that has all the accessibility concerns, which is great.

[29:39] >> All right. I give you a pass. That was a really good answer. Should I have a crack?

[29:43] I'm scared of clicking on JavaScript, but we'll do this. >> You don't have to. You can choose

[29:48] CSS or HTML. It's up to you. >> I'll go JS. You went in the deep end. I'll try that too. Although

[29:52] we come from different backgrounds. So I don't know if I'm going to click and you can read the

[29:56] question. Okay? >> All right.

[29:57] The question is what is strict mode? What are some of the advantages/disadvantages of using it? I'm

[30:06] glad you got this question. I know I can kind of like describe it. But let's see how you do.

[30:11] >> So strict mode is a mode in JavaScript that's a bit more strict where you add use strict at the

[30:18] very top of the file. And it's like basically before TypeScript and flow and all this type

[30:24] safety stuff, it kind of enforced a little bit more rigor in this wild west of JavaScript.

[30:31] Unfortunately, I cannot give you one single example of what strict mode enforces.

[30:37] >> I can't remember either. >> But I remember, yeah, it's just it's

[30:45] almost like a more serious even now in TypeScript you have TypeScript loose, relaxed, and strict.

[30:51] And that was the strict version of just JavaScript. And I cannot for the life of me tell you one

[30:57] thing. But it was like the equivalent of like adding some ESLint stuff that you shouldn't do.

[31:01] >> Yeah. That's a good example. Yeah. So, like, it was like a subset of rules that would, like,

[31:08] fail if you used certain things. Like, I don't think it was as strict as this. But let's just

[31:14] say that one of those rules was like using double equals instead of triple equals. That's the kind

[31:20] of thing. It would say you can't use double equals. You have to use triple equals. Which,

[31:25] yeah, is like an ESLint rule that you might set up for your project where you have a list of

[31:29] things that you want to be able to that you want it to throw errors about or tell you not to do

[31:36] in your code. And so, I guess, yeah, strict mode was like a subset of JavaScript of things you're

[31:42] allowed to do in JavaScript. >> React also has a strict

[31:45] mode and TypeScript has a strict mode. Like, everything has, like, a step up. Like, it's

[31:49] basically the buttoned up, like, to the top version. >> We're taking this seriously now. We're going

[31:55] to a dinner party kind of JavaScript. >> I used to know, like, I probably used to

[32:00] know. But I haven't written use strict at the top of a file in, like, probably a decade. So,

[32:06] that makes it kind of hard to... >> Yeah. It definitely takes me back

[32:09] to, like, yeah, like, pre-job. Like, I feel like even when I was, like, at university,

[32:15] I maybe used use strict. Like, it was kind of a common thing that you put at the top of a file

[32:20] before things like React and Angular and everything else kicked off.

[32:24] >> Yeah. So, when I used to do ThemeForest templates, this is kind of how I got my start

[32:29] into client work. I made templates on ThemeForest and then it got me some street cred and landed

[32:34] some clients. And I remember uploading my first theme. Like, I got rejected many times. But when

[32:39] it was design-wise ready for acceptance, they were, like, they're, like, three or four little

[32:45] things to fine tune and we'll be ready to approve this. One of them is you need to add use strict

[32:50] on the top of the file. And I literally just add use strict and they accepted it. That was my first,

[32:56] like, oh, that's a thing. And then I looked into it and then proceeded to forget about it. That

[33:00] was 2013. So, 11 years ago. >> Nice. All right. So, we're trying to

[33:06] keep these episodes short. So, should we just do one more question each and then wrap it up

[33:10] with some sick picks? >> Yes.

[33:11] >> All right. >> HTML or CSS?

[33:14] >> Let's go HTML. >> All right.

[33:18] >> All right. >> I'm reading. It's for you.

[33:21] Sorry. >> John, question for you. What are

[33:25] empty elements in HTML? >> All right. I don't actually know what

[33:31] empty -- well, okay. All right. I'm going to assume that this means what I used to refer to as

[33:40] void -- no, self-closing tags is what I'm going to go with. And so, I'm going to say empty elements

[33:47] in HTML are a HTML element that doesn't have any children or any content inside of it. And so,

[33:56] something like a horizontal line, for example, that is a HTML element that does not actually

[34:03] have any content inside of it. And so, it just draws a line on the screen and you -- the way

[34:10] that you do that is with a self-closing tag. And so, you have the open angled bracket and then HR

[34:18] for horizontal rule and then space if you want to make it look nice. And then a closing slash and

[34:26] then the angle bracket. You don't have any content in there. It's just the thing itself. It can still

[34:30] have attributes. And so, it could still have an ID and a class and be styled and things like that.

[34:35] But it doesn't have any children elements within it and it doesn't have any content within it. So,

[34:41] it doesn't have any text or anything like that. What do you reckon, Simon?

[34:44] >> I genuinely do not know if that's -- the first thing I thought is exactly that. I was like,

[34:50] yeah, self-closing like an image tag or what you said, the horizontal rule. But then I thought,

[34:56] I don't know if you know, but the template tag in HTML, and it's like a React fragment. A template

[35:01] is a disappearing thing. So, you can put it in your markup and then it disappears. And so,

[35:08] maybe that's what -- because empty elements, like I'm sure some people will see that question and

[35:14] be born and raised with React as the first thing they learn. They're like, oh, it's a fragment.

[35:18] It's an empty tag with no semantic stuff. So, HTML is that template tag, which is -- and if

[35:26] you've done some Vue.js, they use the template heavily, or Alpine.js, because the thing will

[35:30] disappear. So, if you want to do an if/else, you can have a template with the condition and

[35:35] it's going to not render an empty element in the -- so, maybe that's an -- I just said empty

[35:41] element. So, maybe that's how I think. So, what I think is you need to add a button here that says

[35:48] you click and it asks Claude or chatGPT and then it gives us the answer. That would be kind of fun.

[35:52] >> That is a fantastic idea. And PRs are open for anyone that wants to implement this.

[35:59] Oh, Simon's going for it. All right. He's asking chatGPT. Oh, no, he's asking Claude,

[36:04] what is an empty element in HTML? This is a fantastic idea. This is how we get our answers.

[36:09] We don't think for ourselves. We use robots. >> An empty element is an element that does not

[36:14] have any content between opening and closing tags. >> Boom. Boom.

[36:17] >> Self-closing. Line break, horizontal rule, image, inputs, meta, link.

[36:22] >> There you go. But I feel like your answer was also fantastic. I would have given it to

[36:27] you. So, I reckon we both get a point. >> You get a car. Everyone gets a car.

[36:31] >> Everyone gets a totally meaningless point. >> My turn. HTML, you ask the question.

[36:39] >> You want to go CSS. You know you want to go CSS. Oh, no, we're going HTML. All right.

[36:44] Have you used different -- all right. Skip that one. Next one. Have you -- it doesn't really make

[36:50] sense. That's an interview question, but it doesn't make sense in this trivia style of stuff.

[36:55] Consider HTML5 as an open web platform. What are the -- let's go a different one. These suck.

[37:01] What -- this is a fantastic question. What are data attributes good for? This is where you do

[37:10] data dash something. >> Don't start answering.

[37:13] Look at John starting answering for me. First of all, you say data attributes. I say database,

[37:22] but data attributes. >> People always -- like, I work for a

[37:26] database company. And so, people always call me out for my pronunciation of data. And the funniest

[37:33] thing is in tweets, they're always like, dude, it's pronounced data, not data. Hilarious.

[37:38] >> Duh. Duh. So, data attributes -- >> What's data?

[37:44] >> Yeah. So, basically, it allows you to pass any arbitrary attributes to an HTML element. Almost

[37:52] like a React prop. Except it can't be, like, objects and complex stuff. But so, I'll give you

[37:59] a concrete example. If you want to enable dark mode or a special theme on the website, you could

[38:05] have a class that says, like, theme -- that's what I actually do in my free workshop that I'm

[38:09] building. Theme citrus. It's like an orangey, lemony color theme. And you could have a class,

[38:15] and if you add the class to the body tag, then the theme applies. But you could have a data dash

[38:21] theme equals citrus. And then it's much more explicit. It's like, oh, the person looking at

[38:26] the HTML sees data theme. Oh, that's probably a theme explicit way of showing intent. And so,

[38:34] you can do a lot of things like this. And you can access them in JavaScript and you

[38:41] can access them in CSS as well. So, it's super hookable. For example, I've seen people building

[38:47] entire UIs and they use data attributes instead of classes for everything. And then that means

[38:53] that you can completely style them independently of any CSS framework. It gives people just, like,

[39:00] use data dash whatever. In CSS, if you want to target it, you need square brackets around it.

[39:05] So, if it's data theme, you need opening square, data theme equals citrus closing square brackets,

[39:10] that's the selector. And so, you can do really, really cool stuff. And so, you can augment your

[39:16] HTML with, like, pluggable logic stuff. Like, you can do JavaScript or CSS responses to whatever the

[39:24] data attribute is. >> Perfect. I love it. Yes. So, yeah,

[39:31] that is definitely the thing that I found data attributes most useful for is, yeah, being able

[39:36] to select them in both JavaScript and CSS. Like, beyond class and ID, is there a way to just, like,

[39:47] select something based on some other arbitrary prop in CSS?

[39:51] >> Probably. But, like, what you just said, class is meant for styling and ID used to be, like, a

[39:58] unique thing for JavaScript. But you can only have one in the that has to be unique because it's an

[40:04] ID. And then when you use it as a CSS selector, it's got high specificity. So, like, it wasn't

[40:10] designed for the sort of, like, oh, I want to almost annotate my element with, like, a little

[40:16] label or tag or something. Data attributes, exactly that. Yep.

[40:20] >> Yeah. And I guess in JavaScript, like, there's I don't think there's a way to select something.

[40:26] Like, the old way of doing it was get element by ID or get element by class name. And then

[40:33] that got replaced with a query selector, which allows you to basically do, like, a CSS selector.

[40:38] But, yeah, I don't think there's a way to select something other than ID or class name or a data

[40:45] attribute. And so, it gives you, like, that extra escape hatch to have any other piece of data that

[40:52] you want to attach to a HTML element that you then want to be selectable in either JavaScript or CSS.

[40:59] >> So, I'll give you a really concrete example. If you're in React and you want to do, like,

[41:04] prop-based style. You have a button and it has a variant, primary, and secondary. You can do a

[41:10] React prop and it's, like, primary or secondary and you apply different classes. And then if you

[41:15] take this outside of React in HTML, you're toast. Because, oh, there's no props and no components

[41:20] in there. But if you had the exact same components and instead of doing a prop called variant,

[41:26] you did an attribute data-variant equals primary. Data variant secondary. It's still just HTML and

[41:34] CSS. So, you can move that to HTML without React and you can still kind of style the button

[41:40] differently based on the data attributes. Where if it was a variant prop, that's a React JavaScript

[41:46] thing. It doesn't exist in HTML. So, you can be clever about how you if you think you're

[41:52] going to have a part of the website or your application in your company that doesn't use

[41:56] JavaScript frameworks, you're like, oh, use the platform. That was the HTML5 building blocks,

[42:02] the question before. Data attributes is one of the big building blocks. Do I pass?

[42:07] - Absolutely. Flying colors.

[42:10] - John, we have a rule, but I really want to do one CSS question each. So,

[42:13] we've covered the whole loop. My sick pick is CSS and I'm going to ask John a question.

[42:19] - Our first episode trying to go with the shorter format, we have failed. But I love it. Let's do

[42:26] it. - John, question for you. I'm

[42:28] clicking on CSS and asking, can you give an example of a pseudo class and can you provide

[42:34] an example use case for a pseudo class? - Oh, Simon, Simon, Simon. I always forget

[42:40] which one is the pseudo class and which one is the...

[42:43] - Pseudo element. - Pseudo element. Okay. So,

[42:49] I'm definitely not going to be able to distinguish between those two, but maybe you can give us a

[42:53] follow-up answer that can. But a pseudo class, I'm going to say, is something that you can select

[42:59] based on a particular state. And so, a good example of a pseudo class is like hover. So,

[43:06] you want to select, basically, you want to change the styling of like a button when you hover over

[43:12] it. And so, your selector would either select the button element or it might select it by its ID or

[43:18] its class. And then you do colon hover. - Sometimes one, sometimes two.

[43:27] - Sometimes one, sometimes two. - I think one is fine. I always do

[43:30] one. You used to, like, I think there was a browser thing.

[43:33] - Right. I remember when there was a distinction. But yes, I don't think there's a distinction now.

[43:37] And we all use Tailwind anyway. So, there's always a single. So, yes, you do, like, you know,

[43:43] whatever the button selector is. And then colon hover. And then you specify your styles that are

[43:48] specific to when you're hovering. And so, that might be like either underlining the link or

[43:52] something that you're hovering over. Or it might be changing the color of the button. Just to give

[43:58] the user some feedback that they're actually doing something. And that's a clickable element.

[44:02] So, how did I do? - Yeah, that's great. That's

[44:06] exactly right. Pseudo class is a thing that represents a different state. Like hover,

[44:11] active. There's lots, lots, lots, lots of them to get really complex stuff. And I think the

[44:16] difference with pseudo element is when instead of having a div or a span, you have a before or

[44:21] after, which is kind of like a it's attached to the element. You can have before and after. So,

[44:27] if you want, like, a floating quote on a testimonial, you can go before. And then

[44:32] you go position absolute top left, font size, blah, blah, blah. And you position your little

[44:36] quotes without adding an element. - So, that's the distinction

[44:39] between pseudo class and pseudo element. Is a pseudo element is actually, like, a fake element?

[44:45] - Yeah. It's more like a shadow element. - You can treat it like an element.

[44:49] - Yeah. - Yeah.

[44:50] - Right. - That's it.

[44:51] - That makes sense. - Good. Question for me.

[44:53] You gonna read it? - Oh, I'm gonna read it. What is the

[44:56] difference between CSS grid and Flexbox? Come on. How does he get this one? When would you use one

[45:02] over the other? - Listen, man. I've done live

[45:06] workshops. And this is the most asked questions during the live workshops. Because every time

[45:11] you build a UI, people are, like, oh, how do you know when to use? So, the first part of the

[45:16] question is very simple. CSS grid and Flexbox are two completely different layout engines.

[45:21] But the second one, when to use one or another, is kind of, like, more where the money shot is.

[45:29] CSS grid is basically a way to lay out a grid with rows and columns. And then you can assign

[45:35] things to specific columns or, like, cells. Think of a table, Excel sheet. I want to put this image

[45:42] in the row C4 or something like this. And you can skip cells, which means you can have the title on

[45:49] the top left, like we see. And you could have maybe two thirds of the bottom, two thirds of

[45:54] the right in that cell, you could have an image. You can do absolute position, but the grid really

[46:00] gives a grid. And then you can decide if you show the line or not. So, it's like a grid-locked

[46:08] design layout primitive. And then Flexbox is more of a free flowing in one direction thing. So,

[46:16] you can flex horizontal and whatever you put is going to go side by side or flex col, which is a

[46:23] flex direction column, which is, like, vertical. And so, it doesn't have it's a uni-direction

[46:31] concern, where if grid is two directions, X and Y axis, Flexbox is only one. So, you can never say

[46:38] go, like, you can make it wrap. So, it's going to make rows and effectively use multiple dimensions,

[46:45] but it goes horizontal or vertical. And so, when to use which or what, first of all, if you ever

[46:54] -- actually, let me go on my Twitter. There was a really interesting point discussion today.

[47:00] If you don't see, again, you're missing out. Where is Dev Neal who took a screenshot? If I don't find

[47:07] it immediately, I will not show it. But he shared this thing. So, it's a screenshot of my workshop.

[47:14] And basically, it shows a grid of things. It looks like a grid because it's all aligned,

[47:18] but the last row is kind of offset. It's centered and it's breaking the grid rows.

[47:23] And the grid, like, in the DevTools, you can turn on the grid lines, like,

[47:29] the visual representation. So, it really looks like a grid because these lines are turned on.

[47:33] And someone said, hey, how do you actually do the last line kind of offset? And the secret is here,

[47:39] it's using Flexbox. Because it wraps from left to right, and then it has these justify items

[47:47] center. Justify item is on the main axis. And so, the last row is center aligned and it breaks out.

[47:53] It's hard to explain if you're listening, but it breaks out of what looks like a grid for all the

[47:57] other rows. And basically, if you want to do something like this, CSS grid is going to be

[48:03] really not the right decision. Especially in that design, you've got to imagine as the

[48:08] viewport gets bigger or smaller, things wrap and just use whatever space. So, my short answer to

[48:14] the first question, this one, when we use I always say that if you want to let things free, flowy,

[48:24] and use whatever space available, use Flexbox. Flexbox is that elastic, fluid, give me whatever

[48:30] space I have and I'll find a way to fit in. Use Flexbox when you want to do stuff and

[48:36] the available space dictates how they should go. And then use grid if you want it more controlled.

[48:42] I have my grid organization, my sidebar here, the holy grail layout. I want these things like this.

[48:48] And the great thing is you can use Flexbox inside of grids. You can also use grid inside of Flexbox

[48:55] if you want. But think of them as different things. Really, grid is two axis. Flex is one.

[49:01] And grid is very strict control. And Flexbox is free, sometimes magic. A good friend of mine

[49:09] at a conference talk called Flexbox the I'm feeling lucky button they had on Google.

[49:13] Just like, let's put Flex and see what happens. That looks kind of cool.

[49:19] >> Nice. I'm afraid you're completely wrong. You couldn't have been more wrong with your

[49:24] description. I'm joking. That is 100% correct. Well done. Great explanation. Yes, I have an

[49:33] interesting history with grid and Flexbox in that when I started learning to code,

[49:40] it was at university and the courses were outdated and things. So, I learned lots about float layouts

[49:47] and clear fixes and all of that stuff, which I'm sure you would have learned. You would have learned

[49:53] at the right time back when you were actually implementing that when there was no Flexbox

[49:57] and grid. The difference was there was Flexbox and grid. But, yeah, I think grid had just come

[50:07] out. Like, it was supported across all browsers. But it was very early days. And I remember, like,

[50:14] I learned that. And I was like, oh, my god, we don't need floats. This is amazing. This is the

[50:18] tool for everything. And I started trying to, like, wedge everything into this grid layout

[50:23] and try and use that for everything I was designing. And my boss at the time kept being like,

[50:28] I think you should learn Flexbox as well. Grid is appropriate for some stuff. But I think you're

[50:34] maybe making this more complex than it needs to be. I kept being like, no, no, no. Grid's the

[50:39] answer. It's the future. It's everything. It's everything we need to do. And then I learned

[50:42] how to use Flexbox. And I was like, ah, okay. I probably don't need grid for a lot of the things

[50:48] that I'm using it for. And then I think since then, like, maybe used grid, like, a couple of

[50:55] times for a very specific layout where I'm going for that, like, yeah, that table, like, fixed grid

[51:01] thing. But most of the time when you design, well, I find most of the time the things that I'm

[51:05] designing want, like, with that responsive layout need to kind of shift around where they are and

[51:12] where they take up space. And so, having that, like, wrapping Flexbox always, well, pretty much

[51:18] always seems to be the thing that I reach for. What about yourself? Like, how often do you

[51:22] actually use grid? So, listening to you, I feel like I use grid a lot more than you.

[51:26] I'm bad at CS. I'm terrible at it. I do things the wrong way because I don't understand the

[51:33] other way enough. Like, I struggle to explain my reasoning. Like, whenever I see something,

[51:39] I always kind of, like, sometimes you could use both. And when I teach my workshop where we do,

[51:44] like, a grid of logos, I'm like, you could do Flex or grid. And I'm going to show grid. And

[51:49] then in the solution, it shows Flex. And, like, I'm, like, purposely saying, oh, like, depending

[51:53] on what morning I wake up, I would go with this thing. It's not always very clear which one I

[51:58] would choose from. But I tend to use grid for also very small things. And, like, a media object or

[52:07] you think, like, yes, the media object is when you have an image or media on the left. And then

[52:12] title and thing on the right. Like, the typical UI card. Like, a contact card or something.

[52:18] And basically, you can go Flex on the parent. And so, you have the image on the left. And the next

[52:24] one goes on the right. And you add a little gap. And then you can decide which one shrinks or

[52:29] grows based on the elasticity of Flexbox. But you can also have a grid with two columns. And then

[52:35] you go auto and then 1FR. So, I said grid is very strict, but it also has that elastic mindset. So,

[52:42] 1FR is one fraction unit of whatever's available. So, if you go 1FR, it's going to elastically

[52:48] adapt to whatever. So, I know most people for this UI card that you see a contact name,

[52:55] they would go for Flex. But I tend to probably use grid. And then you're, like, what if it goes

[53:01] stacked on mobile? And you're, like, well, it goes from a two column grid to a one column with

[53:05] two rows grid. So, it also has that restructure. It really depends. I really use Flex when I don't

[53:15] know how much space things should use. And I'm, like, I want Flex to decide. Like, the wrapping

[53:20] logos I was showing, like, basically, it's going to spread from left to right. And when there's no

[53:27] more space, it wraps to the next line. And as you grow the viewport, it just reshuffles every time.

[53:31] And that with grid is impossible, because you have to define how many you would have to go.

[53:36] That's 224 pixels. That's three columns. Like, you have to, like, aggressively hard code the

[53:43] grid columns, which goes against the whole idea of flowing, fluid HTML. So, if I don't know what

[53:50] space things should, I'll say Flex, you decide. And if I know what I want to achieve, I tend to

[53:55] use grid. Because it's capable of doing almost the same sort of things with the right wrangling

[54:01] of grid template rows and columns. >> Nice. Well, yeah. And I like what

[54:06] you said before about, like, the top level layout. Like, usually, that's pretty predictable. Like,

[54:10] you want it to be laid out in a particular way on, you know, on desktop and a particular way on

[54:16] mobile. And so, that makes sense to code that out of shell as, like, in grid. And then, yeah, lay

[54:22] things out with Flexbox or whatever. Throughout. This has been fun. This was fun. So, you weren't

[54:30] exposed. If anything, you were, like, look at that explanation of Flexbox first grid. It's amazing.

[54:36] >> We could have gone I'm gonna be very honest now. John shared the link yesterday, and I clicked

[54:44] once on JavaScript just to get a vibe for it, yeah? And the question was, what is currying

[54:50] in JavaScript? And I was, like, oh, come on, man. I've heard of it. I've never used it.

[54:54] >> Can I try and answer it? >> Yes.

[54:56] >> Okay. So, like, yeah, just to give some context as well. Even when I was, like, when I suggested

[55:04] we were gonna do this, that's the thing well, that enclosures the thing that Simon freaked out about,

[55:10] like, having to actually explain. All right. So, currying is a way actually it is a higher order

[55:17] function. It is a way to return a function from another function that sets some of that stuff up

[55:23] for you. And it uses closures to close over oh, look, you've got it up right there. Don't give me

[55:29] the answer. >> You're talking about it, and I'm

[55:34] showing you what I've learned about it. >> It allows you to, like, call one function

[55:39] passing particular arguments, and then it will return you another function that uses those

[55:45] arguments. So, it's a way of creating a closure around those arguments that you fed into it,

[55:50] and it gives you it returns you a function that you can call somewhere else. A way that I've used

[55:55] this a lot in the past is with, like, React when we all moved to React stuff, and you need to set

[56:04] up, like, a back when React was all just frontend stuff. No servers. If I needed to, like, let's say

[56:12] I was building a table that had a collection of items, and I wanted a delete button for each item.

[56:17] Let's say that's a big form or a collection of forms that have a the button submits the form.

[56:29] No, we don't need to do that. All right. We're clicking a button, and the button we want to

[56:34] write, like, a click handler for deleting that item. If we're just iterating over all of the

[56:40] different items in that list to render out a button, we need to know specifically which

[56:47] button we're clicking. Like, which ID does that relate to? And so, currying is a really good way

[56:52] that you can that you can pass an ID into a function to get back the click handler

[57:01] that will delete that specific item. So, it has a closure around the ID that you have passed in

[57:07] to render that button. >> Yeah.

[57:11] >> And it can trigger that as an event handler and delete the correct item from the list.

[57:15] >> So, like, what you explain is how we try to explain closures. Like, it's literally a

[57:21] function that then wraps the little scope that's accessible inside. I don't know if it's true,

[57:27] but when I read the answer, it made an example that makes sense. What it said,

[57:33] it's exactly what you said, but it said, like, if you have a function with multiple arguments,

[57:37] instead of passing them all, the first function calls another function with the next argument,

[57:42] and then it calls another function with the third as a chain. And one of the benefits of that,

[57:49] let me show you the little example if you're watching. Basically, you have a function add

[57:54] number, and you have 1, 2, 3, and this is the normal way, and then the currying would be to,

[57:59] like, return the second number in the function, and then return the function with the number 3.

[58:04] And then basically, it lets you kind of do it's almost like currying is almost like tailwind

[58:09] classes composition, in a way, because instead of having all the concerns handled in one function,

[58:14] you can kind of chain them and think of an array that map, then that filter, then that reduce,

[58:20] and you can have, like, a chain of assembly, and it lets you also make, if you don't want to use

[58:26] the whole assembly line, building the whole car, you're like, no, no, I just want to attach the

[58:29] door. Maybe you can call the whatever, like, find a way to just use that intermediary step.

[58:35] So it's kind of like closure, but in a chained way.

[58:40] >> Yeah. Like, it's a functional programming pattern. So currying is, like, a thing that

[58:46] comes from functional programming paradigm stuff. And so, yeah, that is how you do any kind of

[58:55] programming, and functional programming is that each function is, like, is one individual piece

[59:00] of what you're doing. And so, yeah, you chain them all together, and each function passes the

[59:06] result of that function onto the next function, which passes the result of that function onto the

[59:09] next one. Yeah. >> That's a nice way to break it. Like,

[59:14] things pass the results to the next function. Yeah.

[59:16] >> When I worked at realestate.com.au, Australia's leading real estate company.

[59:23] >> They should sponsor you. Every single time you mention that, you go,

[59:26] "Australia's leading, number one." >> Yeah. Better than Domain,

[59:30] Australia's leading real estate listing site. Yeah, they have a very strong functional

[59:38] programming culture there, and a lot of the back ends are all written in Scala,

[59:41] which is a functional programming language, and that kind of carries through to the front end,

[59:47] where they, at the time that I was there, were encouraging a lot of, like, functional

[59:52] programming style in React, which, yeah, which was kind of nice, because React itself

[59:58] kind of encourages thinking about things in a functional programming way.

[60:03] Rather than mutating state, you are often calling a function that returns you a new thing. So,

[60:09] like you gave the example before of .map on an array, you're not mutating the actual array,

[60:14] you're getting back a new array. So, that's, like, yeah.

[60:17] >> So, you were 100% using Redux, and you were watching the Dan Abramov course on--

[60:22] >> Yeah. Definitely, 100%. >> Because Redux is all about everything

[60:29] you do, you never mutate, you just spread the existing object into your reducer, and you make

[60:34] sure that you just spread things, and use all these ES6 functionalities that let you not mutate,

[60:40] but create a new object, and then you return that, and it's all about basically immutability,

[60:46] in a way, like, not really, but, like, just never mutating something, and always just

[60:50] making a copy, and then returning that. >> Yeah. In fact, before-- the company that

[60:56] I worked at before that used the thing that was the thing before Redux. What is it?

[61:04] >> MobX? >> No, no, it was before that as well. So,

[61:07] I think it may have been called Flow, which was also, like, a type script alternative.

[61:12] But maybe it was called Flow, I don't remember. But there was another thing that was, like,

[61:17] even more ridiculously complex, which then Redux was inspired by, and was fixing. Or Flask, or

[61:27] Fluid, or something like that. Who knows? Something. I'm sure if you look at the Redux docs,

[61:32] it claims what it was inspired by. But yeah, we used that at the company I was at before.

[61:38] Australia's leading real estate listing website. And it was a nightmare. It was very frustrating,

[61:46] as all of these patterns become when they're used incorrectly in a large organization with

[61:50] a lot of devs who partially understand it. >> So, John Myers, the answer was Flux.

[61:56] >> Flux. That's the one. That's it. >> I've asked Claude what was used before.

[62:02] And it said before Redux, blah, blah, blah. >> I felt like there was a play on words with

[62:09] the Redux. I was trying to think what is a name. And that's why Fluid was in my mind. So, yeah,

[62:13] Flux. >> The context API was definitely not before

[62:16] Redux. I don't think so. Yeah, maybe it was. But then there was the use context. So, Facebook

[62:23] developed Flux with Relay and GraphQL and all these things. That's the thing. And then Redux

[62:28] is the one I was thinking of. >> So, Redux has one store that's

[62:32] the single source of truth. And Flux had, yeah, lots of multiple stores. Anyway, Simon, do you

[62:38] have a sick pick for me? Because we've got to wrap this up. >> No, but we should do a JavaScript

[62:41] question. Yes, I have a sick pick. It's called Pixel Perfect Figma to Tailwind. It's six hours

[62:51] left in the discount. And actually, I'm going to pull up here on the thing because I keep showing

[62:58] if I go to epicweb.dev, let me just share my screen one more time. It's like a shameless

[63:03] plug/sick pick in one. I've completely butchered the thing, but that's there you go. So, you can

[63:10] see at the top. Price goes up in six hours, 14 minutes, 7 seconds. So, that's epicweb.dev. And

[63:16] then you can either go in the pro workshops and you will find it here. Or you can click on that

[63:22] banner. And then this is the workshop. I'm already signed in. And, yeah, it's a hands-on workshop. We

[63:30] do not only Flex and Grid, but we also look at subgrid, which is when you have a grid that is

[63:39] offloading its grid cells and rows to the parent grid. So, you can have a parent grid

[63:43] and then two different elements that kind of line up with the parent grid, which is super powerful.

[63:48] It's hard to find a good example. And the UI we built in this workshop is the perfect example

[63:52] for subgrid. So, I've done an exercise on this. And people really loved it. It's typically

[63:58] something you haven't used on your day-to-day life because it's, one, new and, two, very niche. But

[64:05] seeing this, I thought that example made really sense to why subgrid is useful. So, check it out.

[64:11] If you missed the deadline, you can still get it. But it goes up by 20% more after the 6 hours and

[64:17] 13 seconds and 12 minutes. And that's it. >> And remember, everyone, you are now

[64:23] more than six months through your company's education budget. So, if you have any education

[64:30] budget left over, it's time to funnel that towards Simon. And if you do it in the next few hours.

[64:35] >> So, we just missed the end of financial year Australian. And first of June or end of June is

[64:42] the end of, like, where everyone has budgets they need to use. Otherwise, they don't get renewed.

[64:46] We launch right after that, which is kind of like, oh, well. But, yeah. Now you have a new

[64:53] budget for the new year. Go burn it. Burn! >> Or if it's done by just years, calendar years,

[64:59] then you've got less than six months to use it. So, if you're holding onto it for any reason,

[65:03] give it to Simon. >> Yes. So, my sick pick is that. But

[65:07] shout out to Kent C. Dodds who created Epic Web and who chose to reach out to me as to become an

[65:15] instructor. And I'm ever grateful. And I think I did not disappoint so far. So, he's also happy.

[65:20] So, that's pretty cool. But shout out, Kent. You're my sick pick. >> Done a sick pick and a

[65:26] shameless plug all in one. That's excellent. My sick pick this week is going to be an Ooni pizza

[65:33] oven. So, I have a whole history with pizza ovens. I've always been on this hunt to try and make

[65:42] the perfect pizza. And I'm always one step away from the perfect pizza. And so, like >> I know

[65:51] the feeling. >> And so, I built this outdoor pizza oven myself, which I've probably sick picked

[65:58] previously and told you all to do. Don't go do that. I'm un-sick picking building your own pizza

[66:04] oven. Unless you build the proper pizza oven dome with a chimney and follow a proper building

[66:10] schematic or whatever and do it properly. What I did was stack a collection of bricks and a slab.

[66:17] >> You sick picked that one. Yeah, that's cool. >> Two slabs of stone from Bunnings, which is our

[66:23] hardware store. And the way that you offset it means that the heat kind of folds back down over

[66:30] the top of your pizza. The heat part is awesome. It's hard to get it up to proper 500 degrees

[66:38] Celsius is usually what you want to get it to, which is an insane, insane heat. >> Wow, yeah.

[66:44] >> And so, but part of the problem is because it doesn't have a chimney or a way to get rid of the

[66:49] smoke. All of the smoke just like falls over the pizza as well. And like, you know, smoke is a nice

[66:55] flavor if you're like smoking things and whatever. And like, you know, smoky pizza is good. That's

[66:59] why you want to cook it on wood fire. But when it's like just like when it's 100% of the smoke

[67:07] and like the black, like really bad smoke that's just going over your pizza and all the ash and

[67:12] everything from the fire, it's not as pleasant. It ends up being like too smoky and just, yeah,

[67:18] too far. So I bought a Ooni pizza oven. I got the, I think it's the 12G, which is surprisingly

[67:27] affordable for what it is. >> Is it by Ryobi? >> It's not by Ryobi, but it is like the Ryobi

[67:35] of pizza ovens. In fact, it actually is. Like Ooni, I think is like the entry-level, but still

[67:41] good brand, which I think perfectly is Ryobi. Ryobi is made for like people who want to, like

[67:49] the home hardware person who wants to DIY projects at home. It's probably not used by that many like

[67:55] professional carpenters or whatever. But it's the brand that is high enough quality to like,

[68:03] like it's a step up in quality from the entry-level drill or whatever, but it's probably

[68:08] not at that point that a professional will use it. I'd say there'd be like a little bit of overlap

[68:12] into could be used as professional, but probably- >> Yeah, it's hit that sweet spot between the

[68:17] everyday consumer and the pro, like just, yeah, perfect. Keep going. >> So this pizza oven is

[68:23] exactly that. And so it is affordable, but it is fantastic. And so it's like, it's quite small.

[68:30] It's like portable. You can move it around. It's got the dome shape over the top. It's a very like

[68:35] shallow and it's got a chimney and you just, you put like charcoal and bits of wood in a little

[68:42] basket, which is what you like, you burn what's in the basket, the fuel basket. And then that

[68:49] heats up the oven, but it heats it up incredibly quickly. So just like a couple of small pieces

[68:53] of wood and some charcoal, it like heats up the oven to 500 degrees Celsius, probably in like

[69:00] 20 minutes. >> Oh, wow. >> And then it like keeps that heat. You just add like a couple- >> It's

[69:05] uniform, yeah. >> Yeah, yeah. And so the charcoal keeps it like consistent heat. And then the wood

[69:10] gives it some extra flame, which helps color the pizza, helps give it that leoparding on the crust

[69:16] and gives it a little bit of smoke, but not too much smoke that it's like,

[69:21] it tastes like you're eating poison. So it's amazing, like surprisingly good. And you can also

[69:28] get a, I didn't get this, but you can get an optional gas attachment, which turns it into

[69:34] like a gas pizza oven. So if you don't even wanna like mess with fire and charcoal and trying to

[69:40] keep things hot, you can get the gas attachment, which just gives it like perfect uniform heat.

[69:45] It heats up in like 10 minutes to full heat and just stays there and will be completely like

[69:50] consistent the whole time. But I feel like it's a crop out. I feel like I wanna burn the wood. I

[69:57] wanna get some of that like smoky flavor. And so yeah, this pizza oven is incredible and it takes

[70:06] like less than 90 seconds to cook a pizza. That's how hot it is. >> Once it's hot, you just put it

[70:13] for a minute and a half. >> Yeah. Yeah. And so yeah, you've got to like be very strategic with

[70:20] the kinds of toppings that you like. Obviously you wouldn't put raw chicken on your pizza,

[70:25] but if you put just like quite simple pizzas, like tomato based with like some cheese and basil and

[70:32] a fairly minimal pizza cooks perfectly and is absolutely delicious. I give it 10 out of 10.

[70:41] >> That's awesome. And if you want to add chicken or meat or whatever, you can pre-cook it and then

[70:48] put it on top. >> Exactly. Yeah. So if you want to put like mushrooms or chicken or any kind of meat,

[70:54] just cook it first. Obviously pizza goes very well with like cured meats, like salami and

[71:00] ham and all of those things. So they're fine to chuck directly on it. >> So the awesome vibe about

[71:06] this, because it's so quick is we, when we go camping, we have this little camp oven. It's like,

[71:11] doesn't take 90 seconds. It takes more like 90 minutes, but we have like, we have this pizza

[71:16] base from Baker's Delight, which is like a chain of bakeries in Australia. And they do a really

[71:22] good pizza dough that's pre-made. So you literally don't make anything. And then we, we have all

[71:26] these bowls with tomatoes, mushrooms, capsicums, whatever, cheese. And then the kids kind of

[71:32] prepare their little mini pizzas and then put in there. And then you wait for like forever. But I

[71:38] love the, if like, if you have this like party at home and you have all these different ingredients,

[71:42] you're like, Hey, make your own pizza. Give it to me when you're ready. In the minute and a half,

[71:46] you can eat that. So you get from idea. I always talk about this feedback loop. Like I love Tailwind

[71:52] because you have an idea and really quickly you can see it in the browser. So a kid can have an

[71:57] idea about a pizza or an adult. And then within two minutes, it's like ready to eat. And it's,

[72:03] that's pretty cool. Like that's a really good party trick where you assemble the thing and you,

[72:07] it's instantly ready to consume. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good point. I should,

[72:11] should have a pizza party. I've already challenged, I have two other friends who have like

[72:14] different pizza ovens. I've already challenged them to a recurring competition, a pizza cooking

[72:20] competition for the rest of our lives. And so we're going to start in like, in, in a couple

[72:26] of months, we're going to have a, have a pizza competition. We're going to buy a golden pizza

[72:29] peel, which is like the, the thing that you use to put the pizza in. And it goes around to the

[72:34] winner. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And we're going to engrave it every time with the winner. And we've

[72:38] committed to doing this for the rest of our lives. So getting very serious about the pizza game.

[72:43] Yeah. Yeah. My son and daughter both love like preparing the pizza with me. So usually I'll

[72:50] like roll out the dough because they're pretty, like the soft hands and the care that goes into

[72:58] preparing a, like rolling out a pizza dough. But once it's rolled out, they love putting

[73:04] the tomato paste on and like herbs and cheese and stuff. And yeah, that, like that feedback loop

[73:11] is, is so important for kids. Like previously they would make a pizza and then they'd be like,

[73:17] all right, I'm ready to eat. Cause I'm sitting here looking at this delicious pizza that I've

[73:20] made. Then it's like, yeah, cool. Just give me like half an hour to actually cook it.

[73:23] They're sitting there going nuts and like expecting dinner.

[73:28] Inevitably they're still hungry and they'll make one more, but half an hour later, they come to

[73:32] that. The information has come to the brain that no dude, you've eaten, you're good. And that you

[73:37] get that cooked pizza that absolutely nobody wants. Every time we have the, we have the

[73:42] left at the end. And then I either make the mistake of like the dad mistake of, ah, fine.

[73:47] I'll eat all the pizza because I can't wait. But yeah, like the, when we, when we did pizzas on

[73:55] last Friday, uh, like, yeah, just the speed at which it cooked was perfect. So they would prepare

[74:00] it. I'd take it outside. I'd put it in. I'd be out there for like 90 seconds. And then I would

[74:05] come back in. You've got to be like really fast with turning it as well, because it actually does

[74:09] cook like entirely in 90 seconds. Um, and so you got to keep rotating it. So you get, uh, even

[74:14] cooking all the way around the pizza. Um, but then I would come in with this like beautifully

[74:18] steaming pizza and yeah. That's great. Epic. Uh, you, you buy a trailer and then you go,

[74:24] you know, like this little coffee vans that make coffee on the go. You can make these pizzas like

[74:29] in, in one minute, like no one wants to go to a little, little trailer and buy a pizza and wait

[74:35] half an hour. But if you can just get it in one minute, it's, it's awesome. If you took one of

[74:39] these camping, like you could sell it to the whole campground. Like charge 15, 20 bucks a pizza,

[74:45] have some really like basic ingredients that people can choose from, from, and they choose

[74:50] a pizza. Their kids can even get involved in like making their own pizza. And then boom,

[74:54] 90 seconds. You say this because that's a whole business in Australia. I've seen more and more

[74:58] people. There was for long, longest time, uh, the coffee van that shows up or like the,

[75:03] the really annoying ice cream thing with the music where all the kids just, and it's disgusting,

[75:08] warm ice cream. But I've seen more and more of this pizza oven on, uh, like the, the dome one

[75:13] on the trailer. And then they rock up to the camping and they don't even have to play the

[75:18] music. The smell plays the music. Like it's not the kids who want the ice cream. It's the parents

[75:23] who wants the pizza. And then kids, when they smell it, they also like you rock up and literally

[75:28] every single one in the camp run is going to want a pizza instantly. And then if you make it in one

[75:33] minute and it looks steamy, yeah, it's, um, it's, it's a business. Yeah. And pizza is so like easy

[75:40] to eat at like a campground or whatever. Like you just have a slice. You don't need a plate or

[75:44] whatever. Yeah. Not even just wipe on your camping stuff you wear. Cause it's full of dirt anyway.

[75:50] Yeah. Yeah. I love it. Let's pivot. We're no longer, no longer super base. We're now

[75:57] super pizza base and we are pro pizza wind. Yeah. Imagine if you rock up in the camping

[76:03] with your golden shovel thing engraved, like I won in 2024, five, six, and seven,

[76:10] four years in a row. And you get the gold display behind me when I win it in a couple of months,

[76:17] there will be the golden pizza peel hanging behind me. Do you know what should be here?

[76:20] Somewhere here, the YouTube tailwind labs plague, because they're going to reach a hundred K.

[76:26] I'm not going to demand it, but I want, I want Adam to send it to me without me asking.

[76:31] It's not, it's probably not going to happen, but he's got like two. I mean,

[76:35] he created tailwind fair enough. My, my, my work wouldn't reach that amount of people without his

[76:41] work. But as, as far as YouTube is concerned, I've got 98% of the land grab on that YouTube channel

[76:47] to the point people think I am the creator of tailwind, which I do think doesn't sit very well

[76:53] always with the creators of tailwind. But anyway, if you see this item, which you don't, I, the

[76:59] plaque would go well here. See inside, inside of it. Perfect. Nice. I'd shine a lamp on it just

[77:08] to have the little triangle play triangle glow. Yeah. All right. Coming soon. Simon with a silver

[77:15] play button for a hundred K subscribers on YouTube. Thank you all so much for listening

[77:21] to another week of the NavBar and we will see you again next week. See you later. Thanks for

[77:26] joining and let us know if you want more of this stumped question. I think it was fun. Bye.

[77:31] I definitely want more. So let's do one now. No, I'm joking. Bye.
